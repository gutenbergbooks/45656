<p>When the Minister of Public Instruction entrusted me with
the study of the Ancient American Civilisations, you wished to become
associated with my labours in a truly munificent spirit. You will
find in the following pages the result of my discoveries, which, you
are aware, were attended with perfect success. I strove, during the
progress of these studies, to carry out the programme laid down by
you towards the reconstruction of civilisations that have passed away.
I think I have succeeded; and I hope to have sufficiently demonstrated
that these civilisations had but one and the same origin—that they
were Toltec and comparatively modern. If the learned world shall
confirm my theory, and success crown my endeavours; if it shall be
found that I have solved this vexed American question, so hotly
controverted hitherto, it will be mainly due to your generous support.</p>

<p>Pray accept the dedication of this Work as a token of my deep
gratitude.</p>

<h2>TRANSLATORS’ NOTE.</h2>

<p>The justification for having ventured to correct the spelling
of some proper names, and other slight emendations, is to be
found in the Author’s Preface, where he states that “he often
trusted an uncertain memory for his quotations, and that his book
was written between two expeditions.” There is more: it was
deemed advisable, to suit a restless and exacting generation, to
reduce the bulk of the volume, a task which was not undertaken
without fear and trembling, the Translator being painfully
conscious of shortcomings, and that retrenchment may
have been where it should rather have expanded, and expanded
where it should have retrenched.</p>
<hr />
<h2>PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION.</h2>

<p>The first notice upon this work appeared in the <i>North American
Review</i>, the energetic Editor of which (Mr. A. Th. Rice) wished
to be before all his contemporaries in giving his subscribers an
<i>aperçu</i> of my labours. Unfortunately for them that publication
contained my impressions of the moment, just as I dotted
them down, which, as a natural consequence, had to be modified
<i>pari passu</i> with my discoveries, whilst my quotations, owing to
an uncertain memory, were not much to offer readers of such
intrinsic merit. A second publication followed in the <i>Tour
du Monde</i>, but although better thought out than the first, even
that was too hastily written to do justice to the magnificent
collection I now present to the public, in which the entire
design I had at heart is revealed; and if the account of my
discoveries, the issue which naturally follows, the theory I wish
to establish, are still couched in language which may appear
crude and incomplete, I ask the indulgence of my readers on
the plea that this edition received the last touch between two
expeditions. On the other hand the subject is so vast, that
I only aimed at giving a broad outline, hoping for greater
leisure at some future time.</p>

<p>My wish has been so to write as to be easily understood
by all; to this end I have given my book the dual form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">Pg xii</a></span>
a journal as well as a scientific account: in it I recount the
history of a civilisation which has long passed away, which
is hardly known, or rather which has been systematically misunderstood
and misrepresented. My explorations led me to
the uplands of Mexico, the first establishments of the civilising
race, and enabled me to trace the Toltecs step by step to their
highest development in the various regions of Central America,
and not unfrequently to give a certain date, to re-establish
historical truth. There is nothing very extraordinary in this
reconstruction, which, at first beautifully simple, became complicated
with the countless contradictory accounts which have
been published in regard to it. In the hands of the Spanish
padres, origins, however obscure, were made to agree with the
Biblical narrative both in their ponderous commentaries and
their ridiculous systems, which, starting with the confusion of
tongues, travelled on to the lost tribes of Israel, ending with
the legend which ascribes to St. Thomas the apostleship of
America. Modern historians have not been much better in
this respect, and the last century has produced a stupendous
amount of the most extraordinary publications, forming an inextricable
labyrinth, of which the immense compilation of Bancroft
may serve as an example.</p>

<p>The cause of this confusion is twofold: first and foremost,
the destruction of nearly all the Indian documents by the
conquerors; and secondly, the small degree of interest they felt
for anything that dated before their advent. The first accounts,
such as Ixtlilxochitl’s for instance, were written from narratives
more or less trustworthy, delivered from memory by the natives,
in which, as might be expected, the most incoherent traditions
are mixed up with certain historical facts, without discrimination
or the slightest spirit of criticism; for science is but of yesterday,
and archæology, anthropology, and philology were as yet unknown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">Pg xiii</a></span>
This explains why, if we except those things which fell under
their personal observation, later historians are so infinitely
superior to the ancient.</p>

<p>Up to the present day authentic documents have been
wanting; for without any fault or demerit on the part of the
explorers, their drawings of monuments, however carefully done,
could not cope with modern photographs and squeezes. On the
other hand, each traveller writing, it is true, from actual observation,
but confining himself to one district, could only describe
a few of the principal ruins, so that his theory respecting them
was untenable when compared or applied to the ruins of the
whole country. Thus it came to pass that the various epochs
of American civilisation were dealt with as so many distinct
civilisations, producing the utmost confusion. Whereas a sound
study of American civilisation should set aside preconceived
opinions and commentaries, and confine itself to its monuments,
original documents, and such passages in ancient writers descriptive
or explanatory of the end and object of these monuments,
not neglecting the powerful aid of photography and squeezes;
when a judicious and intelligent comparison of the relation these
monuments bear to one another, must soon force the conviction
that, whatever the time which divides them or the difference in
their details, they belong to one and the same civilisation, and
that of comparatively recent date—namely the Toltec.</p>

<p>We shall leave the question of first origins as being unnecessary
for our purpose; as also traditions, prehistoric legends, language,
and religion, confining ourselves to what may be termed history;
that is, beginning with the arrival of the cultured Toltecs in
Mexico. We shall note their establishment in the valley of
Tula, their development on the high plateaux, the disruption of
their empire; how they transmitted their industries and mechanical
arts to the people who succeeded them; and lastly, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">Pg xiv</a></span>
follow them in their exodus and find the traces of their civilisation
everywhere on their passage and in the regions of
Central America.</p>

<p>With regard to my theory on the relatively recent period of
American civilisation and its Toltec origin, I am far from being
the first in upholding it, since Stephens and Humboldt affirmed
it some fifty years ago, whilst all the ancient chroniclers implied
it. Is ancient Egypt less interesting because her MSS. are now
read and her origin known? Why then should the people who
raised the American monuments be less deserving of our regard,
because they built them ten centuries sooner or ten centuries
later? Does it alter the character of the monuments, or destroy
an art unknown to us hitherto?</p>

<p>The question of first origins has always seemed to me
an idle pursuit; and if the evolutionist doctrine is true, a
perfect moral microscope would be required to reach the
remote past of man, whose countless generations, scattered
in every clime, go back to the dark period when our rude
progenitors were hardly distinguished from the brute creation.
Will it ever be possible to penetrate beyond? Besides, our
ancestors have nothing in common with the autochthones of
America, whom I firmly believe to have come from the extreme
East. My reasons for this opinion are based on the fact that
their architecture is so like the Japanese as to seem identical;
that their decorative designs resemble the Chinese; whilst their
customs, habits, sculpture, language, castes, and polity recall
the Malays both in Cambodia, Annam, and Java. The word
“Lacandon,” which is the name of a tribe in Central America,
is also, according to Dr. Neis, that of a race in Indo-China,
who spell it “Lah-Canh-dong.” F. Gamier says that “the
Cambodians build their huts on piles some six or nine feet
above the ground. At first sight it might be attributed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">Pg xv</a></span>
necessity for protecting themselves from inundations; but as
this mode of construction is found in places where no such danger
exists, it must be ascribed to the <i>instinct</i> of a <i>particular</i> race”
(it is the instinct of the Toltecs which caused them to erect their
edifices on esplanades and pyramids); and in his description
of the <i>Khmer</i> monuments at Angor-Tom and Angor-Wat he
adds: “They are placed on pyramids of three to five stories
high,” etc. The analogy is also seen in the ornamentation of
the buildings, where the human figure is rudely treated, whilst
great care is observable in the other decorative designs, a point
which always struck us in American sculpture. It should also
be remarked that bricks covered with plaster, stucco decoration,
cemented floors, roads, and courtyards are common to the Malays
and the Americans; whilst the corbel vault is found in Java,
Cambodia, and America. Again, some temples at Lawoe, in
Java, are built on pyramids, having a staircase on the slope
leading to the edifice, like those of the Toltecs. This resemblance
has struck every traveller, and is the more important that these
monuments only date from the fourteenth or fifteenth century,
and are far removed from those edifices which were introduced
in Java by the followers of Buddha and Brahma; but the destruction
of Indian temples and Indian beliefs was succeeded by
an architectural atavism, a return to a Malay primitive type,
evidenced by the monuments at Lawoe, which I visited in 1878,
a fact which I think of vital importance.</p>

<p>Castes are purely Asiatic and unknown among the Red
Indians, but they existed with the Toltecs, where the commonwealth
was divided into distinct classes of priests, warriors,
merchants, and tillers of the soil; whilst land was held in
common, and a feudal system is apparent with both the Toltecs
and Malays. Two languages are used in Java and Cambodia;
one to address superiors, the other for the vulgar. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">Pg xvi</a></span>
also the case with the Toltecs, and gave rise to two different
written languages. Finally, the worship of serpents as gods
of wisdom, like Quetzalcoatl, is found in India, Greece, China,
Japan, and particularly in Cambodia and Java. To us these
points of resemblance are more than mere coincidence; something
better than fortuitous analogies: they seem to point to a vast
and novel field for the investigation of archæologists.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="center">VERA CRUZ AND PUEBLA.</p>

<p class="indent">My former Mission—The present one—Why called Franco-American—Vera
Cruz—Railway from Vera Cruz to Mexico—Warm Region—Temperate
Region—Cordova—Orizaba—Maltrata—Cold Region—Esperanza—Puebla
and Tlascala—The Old Route.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I started for Mexico in 1880, I already knew something
of the country, having, in the year 1857, been sent out as delegate
for my Government to explore parts of it. At that time I was
rich in hopes and full of grand intentions, but poor in knowledge
and light of purse, and I soon learnt that the work I had undertaken
was of so difficult and complicated a character, that the
whole thing was beyond my powers; and, finding that from
want both of money and of technical knowledge I was unable
to carry out the great schemes I had imagined, I contented
myself with simply photographing some of the monuments as
I visited them, without even venturing to add any comment
thereto. Now all was different. Better prepared in every way:
with additional knowledge, backed by influential supporters, and
with the aid of numerous documents which I had collected, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">Pg 2</a></span>
felt I might reasonably hope to be able to throw some light
on one of the most obscure corners of the history of man.</p>

<p>But at the very moment when the Minister of Public
Instruction, on the advice of the Commission for Missions and
Travels, was again entrusting me with the exploration of Mexico,
that I might study its monuments, it so chanced that a rich
American, Mr. Lorillard, of New York, was also minded to fit
out a scientific expedition for the same purpose, and that I was
the man he had fixed upon to direct it. The latter had already
set apart a considerable sum of money for the expedition, so that
I found myself placed in a somewhat delicate position, for, by
refusing Mr. Lorillard, I should have risked a dangerous competition
in the very country and the very places I was to
explore; and, by accepting, I should have seemed to give up
my nationality, and to deprive my own country of many precious
documents and interesting collections. I felt myself, therefore,
fortunate in being able to combine the two rival expeditions,
and, under the name of a Franco-American Mission, to carry
out the important work, and in this I was assisted by the
unparalleled generosity of Mr. Lorillard, who gave up to France
all the fruits of my labour, my researches, and my discoveries.
It was under such circumstances that I started on the 26th of
March, 1880, and taking New York on my way, to pay my
respects to my generous sleeping-partner, I reached Vera Cruz
at the end of April.</p>

<p>The aspect of Vera Cruz, seen from the sea, is anything but
pretty, consisting of a monotonous line of houses, blackened by
heavy rain and the driving <i>Norte</i>. Built on a sandy shore,
surrounded by barren hills stripped of all vegetation, and low-lying
lagoons, Vera Cruz may safely be pronounced the most
unhealthy place in Mexico. Yellow fever is never absent from
its shores, and with every new batch of immigrants it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">Pg 3</a></span>
epidemic and violent in the extreme, fastening on the newcomers
with unusual severity. We learnt that to our cost, at
the time of the war of intervention, when our soldiers were
literally decimated by this fearful scourge. It became necessary
to replace the white troops by negro battalions, the latter withstanding
better than Europeans the fury of the epidemic.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-003.jpg" width="500" height="348" alt="A VIEW OF VERA CRUZ AND THE FORT OF SAN JUAN OF ULLOA." />
<p class="caption">A VIEW OF VERA CRUZ AND THE FORT OF SAN JUAN OF ULLOA.</p></div>

<p>Vera Cruz can scarcely be said to possess a harbour, having
only an indifferent anchorage, in which ships are far from safe.
Fort St. Juan affords the only shelter, but in bad weather vessels
frequently break from their moorings, and are thrown or driven
on to the coast. A storm here is synonymous with north wind,
and when it blows no words can give an adequate idea of its
violence; it is not a straightforward, honest tempest, such as
every good manner knows how to cope with, but it comes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">Pg 4</a></span>
terrific and sudden squalls, carrying whirlwinds of sand, which
penetrate the best-closed houses; consequently, on the first
indication of its approach, every dwelling is securely fastened,
barges are taken in and chained up, vessels lower their double
anchors, the harbour becomes empty, all work is suspended,
and the place wears the aspect of a deserted city. The thermometer
falls suddenly, the porter, with teeth chattering, wraps
himself in his blanket, a woollen overcoat is quickly substituted
for the ordinary white holland jacket, and every one goes about
shivering with cold. The pier is soon hidden by the huge waves
raised by the disturbed element, in the harbour vessels get foul
of one another, and steamers to avoid shipwreck get up steam,
ready to take their station outside.</p>

<p>Vera Cruz welcomed us with one of these strong north winds,
which obliged us to stay for three days in the roadstead, unable
to leave our steamer; and when I <i>did</i> land, I was so glad, so
happy at once more feeling the ground under my feet, that I
failed to notice, as I had done before, the very uncomfortable
pavement of the town, which consists of sharp pointed stones;
but just as a sheep has a portion of his fleece torn from him by
every bramble he passes by, so does every traveller leave some
portion of his individuality in every country which he visits—and
on seeing again the places he has known before, he thinks
to himself that he will be welcomed by the same impressions,
the same friendships, nay, the same adventures as before will be
there. He believes he will find everything exactly as he left
it, he looks forward to shaking hands with a particular friend,
to revisiting a certain spot, to entering a certain house, whose
kind inmates had always had a warm welcome for him. He
arrives, but the scene is changed, the old well-remembered spot
is laid waste, the house a heap of ruins, friends dead, and Time,
alas! has done its fatal work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">Pg 5</a></span></p>

<p>After two-and-twenty years’ absence, I eagerly looked forward
to shaking hands with the friends I had left. The returning
traveller looks back on two-and-twenty years as but a day; to
him it seems but yesterday that he left the place; every one
will, of course, know him again; every one will come forward
and warmly welcome him back. Heaven help him! The
quarter of a century, which he has hardly taken into account,
has in reality weighed heavily on him, as upon all; even should
he be fortunate enough to recognise a few acquaintances, they
have completely forgotten him, and like Rip Van Winkle, he
seems to awake from a hundred years’ sleep—to find all changed,
and everything about him strange and new. In my own case,
the only friend I found was the oldest of all, whom I thought
I was never likely to see again. But it was not until I had told
him my name that he recognised me; for at first he saw nothing
but a perfect stranger standing before him. I inquired after A—he
was no more; and B?—dead; and C?—dead also. I stopped,
I was afraid to go on. It was under the burden of impressions
such as these that I found myself once more in Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>And yet Vera Cruz, situated at the extremity of the Mexican
gulf, is not commonplace, but rather an Eastern city, and her
origin is marked everywhere; in her cupolas, painted white, pink,
and blue, her flat terraces, and ornaments mostly of a pyramidal
form. But cities live longer than men, and I found Vera Cruz
rejuvenated, younger and more animated than of yore.</p>

<p>A slight breath of French activity seems to have crossed the
seas and to pervade everything. The houses are freshly painted,
the steeples whitewashed, cupolas enamelled, and new blocks
of houses and monuments meet the eye in all directions. The
square, which was formerly squalid and intersected by watercourses,
is now a charming place, paved with marble and planted
with trees, in which squirrels and ouertitis gambol and play the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">Pg 6</a></span>
whole day long. The centre is occupied by a fountain, and the
sides by arcades, giving access to magnificent <i>cafés</i>, beautiful
shops, the Cathedral and the Town Hall inlaid with gleaming tiles.</p>

<p>In the day-time the shade is deep and the air cool, whilst
in the evening numerous loungers and fair women, their hair
chequered with phosphorescent <i>cucuyos</i>, fill the green walks,
and give it the appearance of a huge hot-house. Vera Cruz, to
those who are used to its climate, is a very pleasant abode, and
though in some respects not so desirable as many European cities,
life here, on account of the great heat, is easier, fuller, more
satisfying. Wines are not dearer than in Paris; fish is both
plentiful and excellent; tropical fruit of every kind is to be found
in the market, as well as all the feathered tribe, varying from
the laughing-bird and the parrot to the beautiful red and green
Aras of Tabasco. Add to this the constant incoming and outgoing
of every nation in the universe, eliciting a daily interchange
of news with the outer world, and in a sense annihilating the
distance which divides you from the mother country. Then,
too, there is the Gulf with its blue waters, tempting to the most
delightful dives man ever had; the jetty, which, insignificant
though it be, is none the less a favourite resort, where in the
evening people go for a little fresh air, beneath a magnificent
canopied sky; and where in the day they can watch on the
horizon the white sail disappearing out of sight. Picture to
yourself this marvellous sky, filled with innumerable noisy sea-birds
and small black vultures dotting it at a dizzy height, whilst
far below, hoary, venerable pelicans, quite at home in the harbour,
from long habit seem to spend their lives in diving and rising
solemnly, then come and perch on the Custom House flag, with
a grotesque kind of dignity, as though conscious of having fully
done what was expected of them.</p>

<p>But the great feature about Vera Cruz is the innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">Pg 7</a></span>
flights of black vultures, which fill the streets, and cover every
roof and pinnacle. They are so tame as to be scarcely disturbed
by the passers-by, and when servants throw out house refuse,
there follows a general rush and a fearful fight, in which dogs
take part, without, however, always getting the best of it. These
dogs, like those of Constantinople, are the ædiles of both town
and country, which without them would be intolerable.</p>

<p>Beyond Mexico Gate, a fine public walk, planted with large
cocoa-trees, leads to a suburb which has within the last few
years grown into a little town; it is the great rendezvous for
sailors and coolies who come to dance and flirt with the damsels
of the place, and the evening is generally wound up with a
hot dispute with their less favoured companions.</p>

<p>The coast along the Atlantic is a vast sandy plain, diversified
by marshes peopled with herons, wild ducks, iguanas, and serpents,
which are almost impervious from thickets of aromatic shrubs
and wild flowers, in the midst of which tower magnificent trees;
but the sound of no voice ever breaks on this wilderness in
which lurks the <i>malaria</i>, save the hoarse cry of a wild animal,
the passing of an eagle-fisher, or the whirling of a vulture in
quest of some easy prey.</p>

<p>The journey from Vera Cruz to Mexico is now performed
by railway, which has replaced the once cumbrous diligence,
and traffic has increased to such an extent that the English
Railway Company is unable to convey inland goods which have
come by sea.</p>

<p>We start on our journey with an escort, even now a necessary
precaution, for five-and-twenty years have not modified the
manners of the natives, and highway robbers are still a flourishing
institution in Mexico.</p>

<p>Pressing westward, we go through the sandy, marshy zone,
and leaving behind us Tejeria, Soledad, Paso Ancho, and Paso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">Pg 8</a></span>
del Macho, we reach the famous Chiquihuite bridge, when a
glorious region succeeds to the flat country and parched vegetation
of the coast; we continue to ascend through grander and grander
scenery and more luxurious vegetation, having on our left the
river Atoyac with its precipitous course, between deep ravines,
and presently we come in sight of the iron viaduct, which is
considered one of the best works on the line.</p>

<p>Still pressing upwards we reach the temperate zone, where
we find coffee, tobacco, and banana plantations, spreading their
broad green leaves under the shade of great trees which shelter
them against the fierce heat of the sun; while little houses,
embowered in orange-groves and creepers, peep out coquettishly
from leaf and foliage.</p>

<p>And now the grand outlines of the Sierra are about us, and
at every bend of the road charming views unfold before our
enraptured gaze; a dazzling light colours all things with the
richest tints, and Orizaba rears its magnificent head straight
before us. Orizaba is, with the Popocatepetl, the highest
mountain in Mexico; its snowy peak is visible for many a
mile at sea. At its foot may be seen the city of the same
name, extending over a large area, with her numerous and
once gorgeous churches, now falling into decay, amidst a vast
plateau, circled by mighty mountains, once gleaming with volcanic
fires and grand summits. Mills and factories, greatly on the
increase, are worked by water-power, which is brought by
aqueducts or mountain torrents.</p>

<p>After Orizaba, the road becomes very steep; we enter the
gorges of Infiernillo (small hell), where, along roads coasting
deep ravines and unfathomable precipices, spanned by stupendous
bridges, we reach Maltrata, where the train stops to change
engines, when we ascend the heights, or <i>cumbres</i>, leading to
the plateau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">Pg 9</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-009.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="VIEW OF PUEBLA, TAKEN FROM ALTO." />
<p class="caption">VIEW OF PUEBLA, TAKEN FROM ALTO.</p></div>

<p>And now the road opens out in long windings, rounding
the steepest declivities; bridges and tunnels succeed each other
with dazzling rapidity, and the huge engine puffs and hisses,
sending out long, curling volumes of white smoke over the
most glorious landscape; and our journey, which has lasted
three hours, brings us to Esperanza, at an elevation of some
1,200 metres,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and here we breakfast at an excellent buffet. After
Esperanza, the country becomes a dreary, monotonous, dusty
plain, contrasting painfully with the brilliant colouring of the
warm zone; not a tree is to be seen, hardly any vegetation;
some rare fields of stunted maize and wheat, a few meagre
cactuses, with here and there a white hacienda, are the only
indications that this forlorn region is not wholly uninhabited.
Nevertheless, the monotony of this immense plain is relieved
by the grand outline of mountains which bound the horizon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">Pg 10</a></span>and the sand mounds, which are visible everywhere, give the
landscape a peculiar and somewhat severe aspect.</p>

<p>The railway, strange to say, has deprived this region of its
few inhabitants, and steam has done away with the <i>arriero</i> and
the long lines of heavy carts, panting mules, and muleteers in
picturesque costumes, and the tinkling bells of <i>madinas</i> (mules
heading the trains) are no more.</p>

<p>Then, also, these dusty roads were enlivened by the presence
of small cottages, whence the cheerful hand-clapping of <i>tortilleros</i>
reminded the hungry traveller that here his honest hunger might
be appeased, during which the muleteer would ogle or distribute
somewhat questionable compliments among the belles of the
district; all is gone, even to the <i>meson</i>, in whose vast courtyard
weary mules were put up for the night. The cottage
has left no trace behind, the walls of the <i>meson</i> are a mass of
ruins, and the courtyard deserted.</p>

<p>And now we travel in a north-west direction; we pass
Huamantla, round Malinche, and leave Puebla some twenty
leagues on our left, and crossing Apizaco we reach the Llanos of
Apam, famed for its <i>pulque</i>, or Mexican wine, which is made of
the juice of aloes (<i>Agave Americana</i>), to be found everywhere;
but Apam pulque is as superior to other pulque as Chambertin
is superior to ordinary claret. Aloe plantations are everywhere
to be seen, and at each station a huge train calls daily for the
casks full of the liquor so dear to Mexicans. This intoxicating
beverage is not tempting in appearance, for it is yellowish, thick
and stringy, with a most repulsive smell, yet when a taste for it
has been acquired even Europeans drink it with pleasure after a
day’s trip. Here I am reminded how much the railway has
destroyed the picturesqueness of the road. If in former times the
traveller went over the ground at a slower pace, he had leisure to
linger over the plain, admire the mountain round which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">Pg 11</a></span>
railway now twines, to stop at Amozoc, a time-honoured haunt of
brigands; and though he missed Tlascala, the faithful ally of
Cortez, and the hereditary enemy of Mexico, he had the opportunity
of visiting Puebla de los Angeles, which lies at the very
foot of great Malintzi or Malinche, faced by the snowy peaks of
Iztaccihuatl and Popocatepetl.</p>

<p>The city of Puebla de los Angeles was founded by the
Spaniards soon after the conquest, on the site of an insignificant
village a few miles east of Cholula. After Mexico, which it rivals
by the beauty of its edifices, it is the most important city of New
Spain. Like ancient Cholula, she is remarkable for the number
and the magnificence of her sacred buildings, the multitude of
her priests, and the pomp of her religious ceremonies, and her
cathedral, in an architectural point of view, ranks as high as
that of Mexico, whilst her treasures are perhaps even more
considerable than those of her rival—her grand chandelier of
massive silver having alone cost £14,000. The innumerable
steeples of a hundred churches, and the gleaming cupolas, give
a remarkable character to the panorama of this city, which has
sustained many a siege, while her last defence under Ortega was
simply heroic.</p>

<p>In the time of the diligence the road led to ancient <i>Cholula</i>,
and the traveller had the opportunity of visiting her pyramid, on
which stands the temple dedicated to Quetzacoatl, “God of the
air,” who was pleased to dwell among men, and, during his visit
in Cholula, which extended over twenty years, he taught the
Toltecs the arts of peace, a better form of government, and a
more spiritualised religion, in which the only sacrifices were the
fruits and flowers of the season. It was in honour of this
benevolent deity that this stupendous mound was erected. The
date of its erection is unknown, for it was found there when the
Aztecs entered the plateau; but it has been variously ascribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">Pg 12</a></span>
to the Olmecs, the Toltecs, and even to a race of giants, who
wished to save themselves from another deluge. Clavigero
observes very naturally, that the builders were rather stupid in
taking so much trouble to raise an artificial mound, when they
had within reach the highest mountains in the world where to
take refuge in any such emergency.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> It had the truncated,
pyramidal form of the Mexican <i>teocalli</i> (temple), its four sides
facing the cardinal points, and divided into the same number of
terraces. The original outlines, however, have been effaced by
the action of time, while the growth of shrubs and wild flowers,
which cover its surface, gives it the appearance of one of those
symmetrical elevations thrown up by Plutonic agency rather
than the work of man. The height of this pyramid is 60 metres;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
its base, which is square, covers about forty-four acres, and the
platform on its truncated summit embraces more than one.
Cholula was of great antiquity, and was founded by the primitive
race which occupied the land before the Aztecs. At the time of
the conquest it was one of the most populous and flourishing
cities of New Spain. “Nothing could be more grand than the
view which met the eye from the truncated summit of the pyramid.
Towards the north stretched the bold barrier of porphyry rock
which nature has reared round the valley of Mexico, with the
huge Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl standing like two sentinels to
guard the entrance of this enchanted region. Far away to the
south was seen the conical head of Orizaba soaring high into the
clouds, and nearer, the barren, though beautifully shaped Sierra
de Malinche, throwing its broad shadows over the plains of
Tlascala. Three of these volcanoes, higher than the highest
peak in Europe, and shrouded in snows which never melt under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">Pg 13<br />Pg 14<br />Pg 15</a></span>
the fierce sun of the tropics, at the foot of the spectator the sacred
city of Cholula, with its bright towers and pinnacles sparkling in
the sun, reposing amidst gardens and verdant groves. Such was
the magnificent prospect which met the eye of the conquerors, and
may still, with slight change, meet that of the modern traveller, as
he stands on the broad plateau of the pyramid and his eye wanders
over the fairest portion of the beautiful plateau of Puebla.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>Cholula was the holy city of Anahuac, the Mecca, Jerusalem,
and Rome of the Indians; in it the kindred races had temples
of their own, and ministers for the service of the deity to whom
they were consecrated. The sanctity of the place brought
pilgrims from the furthest corners of Anahuac, who came to offer
up their devotions at the shrine of Quetzacoatl and other
divinities. Here Quetzacoatl had dwelt, and on his departure
for the countries of the East, he had bidden his followers to keep
fast his teaching, promising that he and his descendants would
return, to reign again over them. This remarkable legend, which
was popular with all the Indian tribes, was one of the most
powerful auxiliaries of the Spanish conquerors, in whom the
simple Indians thought they recognised the lofty stature, noble
mien, clear complexion, and blue eyes, of the deity they had so
long expected.</p>

<p>But talking of Cholula has made us forget that the train is
going to start: the guards, hurrying in every direction to look
for us, summon us into our carriages, the signal is given, and we
speed away.</p>

<p>And now we notice on the platform of every station, detachments
of soldiers, with large felt hats, trimmed with silver
ribbons and tassels, whilst their horses, ready saddled, are
stationed close by. In spite of their baggy trousers and slouching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">Pg 16</a></span>hats, these men have a military bearing, which shows them to
be a picked body of troops, and in fact they are the “rural
guard,” lately formed, but already of the greatest service; thanks
to their vigilant intelligence, the country is almost safe. This
guard is recruited among the class described as “having no
occupation and no permanent abode,” and the Government gave
proof of its sagacity when it availed itself of this turbulent
element, which after having been the scourge of the country,
now keeps it quiet. It is a case of setting a thief to catch a
thief; for the “rural,” acquainted for twenty miles round with
all the “old customers,” whose accomplice he used to be, knows
better than any one how to track an escaped convict, or discover
a secret haunt; and thanks to telegraphs and railroads, <i>pronunciamentos</i>
have gone out of fashion, nipped in the bud before they
are given time to assume any large proportions.</p>

<p>From Apam, where we got out to look at the view, we
proceed to Palma; then Otumba, where Cortez, a few days
after his evacuation of Mexico, obtained a great victory
over the Aztecs, in which their chief was slain; and leaving
Teotihuacan with its pyramids on the left, we reach Mexico
and St. Cosme Station.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="center">MEXICO.</p>

<p class="indent">Her New Appearance—Moral Transformation—Public Walks and Squares—Suburbs—Railway—Monuments—Cathedral—S.
Domingo—S. Francisco—La
Merced—Hats <i>à la</i> S. Basilio—Suppression of Religious Orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mexico</span> has undergone a still greater change than Vera Cruz.
The large square, which used to be ill-paved and empty, has
become a fine garden, planted with eucalyptus trees, which have
grown wonderfully during the last twelve years, some measuring
seven feet in girth and over 100 feet in height. Beneath the
shade of these beautiful trees stretch beautiful gardens and green
turf, whilst the centre is occupied by the Zocalo, a pavilion, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">Pg 18</a></span>
which every evening very fair concerts are given, attended by
the Mexican society.</p>

<p>Spacious houses in modern style have been constructed at
different points of the city; new districts have arisen on the
site once occupied by convents; pretty squares are distributed
about, and the Paseo Nuevo, which was to extend as far as
Chapultepec, is one which the proudest cities in the world might
envy. But will it ever be completed? At present, it only
reaches the imposing monument erected in honour of Christopher
Columbus, which every Frenchman should admire as coming from
Paris and the work of a Frenchman. The immediate area
round Mexico has been completely transformed by lines of railroad
and tramways; in places once occupied by fetid water or
marshy ground, pretty villas and flower gardens are now to be
seen, whilst on the other side of the Paseo, to the right and
left of S. Cosme, the smaller suburbs are extending so fast that
they will soon join the main city. Should Americans come—and
a goodly number are here already—all this land, now almost
valueless, would in a few years double and treble in price.</p>

<p>But what is still more remarkable is the moral transformation:
a new life seems to animate Mexico: education, trade, industry,
and public works, have received great development; security has
increased, a public conscience has been awakened, ideas have
become more liberal, change of power is now effected without
disturbance, whilst formerly it was preceded, accompanied and
followed by the ever-recurring <i>pronunciamentos</i>; a feeling of
good-fellowship begins to penetrate all classes, and Government
House is in a true sense the House of the people, being
filled from early morning by friends, employés, or petitioners.
Every one is free to come and go, without let or hindrance,
all are received by the Governor without having to ask an
audience, and every one is welcomed with the greatest affability,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">Pg 19</a></span>
as I can from personal experience amply testify. To give an
idea how far the spirit of patriotism was roused by the war of
intervention, I will quote the words of a deputy, who, on my
preliminary bill being submitted to Congress, which had been
agreed to between the Government and myself respecting my
excavations and their export, rushed into the tribune to speak
against its adoption. “Gentlemen,” he cried, “I feel savage,
beside myself, almost idiotic, when the interests of our country
are at stake.” The speaker was right in his description of
himself, for the removal of a few fragments from the soil of
the Republic was not deserving of such an outburst.</p>

<p>But it is the privilege of the young ever to exaggerate, and
Mexico is as yet in her youth. The public press is just started,
and there are but two independent papers, the admirably conducted
Republican <i>Moniteur</i> and the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, which
give any profits. All the others are paid by the Government,
are short-lived, and disappear one after another, to reappear under
new names and take up with a different party. And yet there
is no lack of talent, the drawback is in the difficulty of communications.
The heavy postal charges (a letter from one village
to another costs one shilling), the ignorance and indifference of
the masses about political events, are the main causes which
prevent any newspaper from succeeding. The only interest
evinced in politics is at the time of the elections, and even in
these, Mexicans take very little interest, knowing beforehand that
it will not much matter to them, and that their burden will hardly
be made lighter. It may be safely predicted that the Indians
will not be roused from their apathy until they are better educated,
and until they discover that they have a direct interest in mixing
in politics—for which they are eminently qualified—and if their
vast majority be considered, they would undoubtedly contribute
a large contingent, whilst their industry, their intelligent quickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">Pg 20</a></span>
to seize everything, coupled with a natural talent of adaptation,
would soon raise them to the foremost ranks in the army, politics,
the bar and science, as may even now be seen in the few who
have had the privilege of education; nor would this be difficult,
for they now stand on a perfect footing of equality with the
Mexicans, for unlike most conquerors, jealous to preserve their
nationality, the modern Mexicans repudiate their Spanish descent
and are proud to call themselves Indians. But what is to be
the outcome of it all? Will the Indian, forgetting his humble
and thrifty aspirations, thirst, like the Mexican, after Government
employment, which, whilst it keeps him idle, unfits him for
commercial and industrious pursuits? He has lived hitherto
under laws harsh and severe for him alone; is there no fear
that once free, he will plunge into the vices of freed men, rather
than put on the virtues of civilised people? If we are to borrow
our experience from the past, this would be the case, since when,
shortly after the conquest, he lived under milder laws, the effect
was to sink him into such an appalling condition of moral depravity
as to move the good Franciscan monk Sahagun to say
of him: “We ought not perhaps to be surprised at finding
among them the usual shortcomings which belong to their country,
since the Spaniards who live here, and especially the American
born, are in no way better than the Indians. Even the natives
of Spain, after a few years in this country, are quite altered, and
I have always ascribed this change to a difference of climate and
latitude. It is humiliating to our feelings as Christians,” exclaims
Sahagun, “to reflect that the Indians of olden time, wise in their
generation, knew how to remedy evils peculiar to the soil, by
means of practices which were their safeguard, whereas we
succumb to our evil propensities; the result of which is that we
see a new generation, Indian as well as Spanish, rising around
us, which it is difficult to manage or to save. Parents have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">Pg 21</a></span>
that authority they ought to have over their offspring to guard
them against their natural proclivities. The ancient dwellers of
this soil were far better inspired when they abandoned the
education of their children to public authority, which replaced
paternal rights. Unfortunately this method was tainted by
idolatrous and superstitious practices; but were these to be
eliminated and the ancient method introduced afresh among the
Indo-Spanish people, a great public good would undoubtedly
follow, which would relieve the Government of many difficulties
now pressing upon it. As it is we hardly know how to deal
with those reared in our schools, who, finding themselves no
longer checked by the fear and discipline of former, nor the
severity of pagan times, do not care to learn and are indifferent
to admonition; very different in this respect from their Aztec
forefathers. At first, following their ancient practice, which
placed the youth of both sexes in buildings within the enclosure
of their temples, in which they were drilled in monastic discipline,
and taught to reverence their gods and obey the laws of their
country, we tried to bring them up in our establishments, and to
this end we collected them in buildings adjoining our houses, in
which they were accustomed to rise in the middle of the night to
sing the matins of Our Lady, and recite the ‘Hours’ at early
dawn; they were also required to beat themselves with stripes
and to spend some time of the day in mental exercises, but as
they were not compelled as in pagan times to do any manual
labour, as their natural aspirations seemed to demand, and as
moreover they were better fed and more mildly treated than their
student ancestors, they soon learnt and fell into evil ways. We
also directed our attention to the women to see whether it were
possible to place them in convents, as in heathen times, and with
this end in view we made them Christian nuns, and imposed on
them perpetual vows; convents and retreats were erected, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">Pg 22</a></span>
which they were taught their religious duties and the art of
reading and writing. Such as had shown themselves proficient
in these pursuits and were possessed besides of becoming dignity
and decorum, were chosen to preside over these establishments
as guides and teachers of Christianity and purity of life<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>. At
first we fondly hoped, as in the men’s case, that they would
become worthy and spotless nuns, but we were mistaken, experience
having shown that, for the present at least, they were
incapable of so much perfection, and convents and conventicles
had to be abolished, and we have to confess that the time has
not yet come for repeating the experiment.”</p>

<p>The passage just quoted is suggestive of many things.</p>

<p>A deplorable change for the worse is already observable
in the character of the Indians of Tabasco and Chiapas since
the Suffrage Bill, which by making them partly independent
of the whites, has also made them idle, insolent, treacherous,
and depraved. A sad look-out for times to come. But even
granting that all happens for the best, is there much probability
that the Indian will have time to develop his natural resources
before the Anglo-Saxon invasion shall have confined him for
ever to the lower ranks in the social scale?</p>

<p>However that may be, Mexico, although bent on progress,
seems only to receive her notions second-hand. Eager for action,
every new idea or advance which has received a trial with other
nations, is sure to be promptly adopted, without any inquiry
whether it is applicable, suitable, or useful, among a people
wholly unprepared to receive them; and this total impossibility
of legislating for half savages and illiterate people made a deputy
say one day to me: “We have a constitution fit for angels,
whereas we ought to have one fit for asses.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">Pg 23</a></span></p>
<p>What happens? The Mexicans at present enjoy perfect
liberty, which they use to stop the action of the Government,
and as each department is entirely independent, the lowest
clerk is able to stop the whole machinery. Most Mexicans
have, or wish to have, Government employment, leaving to
foreigners the development of their national wealth; banking,
trade, and the working of their rich mines are, with few exceptions,
in the hands of Spaniards, French, English, and
Americans. The latter are swarming in; and, save Vera Cruz,
all the railways are American.</p>

<p>Very few Mexicans have been found willing to risk their
capital in these important enterprises, being satisfied with receiving
a premium, or joining the companies as employés. What
will happen? It would be a strange and novel phenomenon
to see a superior (?) race disappearing before an inferior one.
Be that as it may, it is certain that on the day when the Anglo-Americans
shall be able to dispense with the services of the
Mexican, they will not scruple to thrust him aside, careful
however to keep the Indians of the Highlands, now a docile,
frugal, hard-working people, whom they will use for mining
and agricultural purposes, as well as for the construction of
railways. But this is not yet. The absorption will come,
however—gradually, silent, peaceful—a slow, easy death, but a
sure death nevertheless.</p>

<p>Yet it would be a matter for regret that this attractive people,
open to every new idea of progress, eager to distinguish themselves,
as shown a hundred times in the defence of their liberties,
should be swallowed up by the Saxon element. The “Timeo
Danaos dona ferentes” is surely applicable here, and Mexico
should beware of her powerful neighbour—<i>Caveant Consules</i>.</p>

<p>Mexico has a great wealth of monuments, palatial houses,
and churches, the finest of which is the Cathedral, occupying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">Pg 24</a></span>
the northern side of the Place d’Armes, with the Palace to the
east, the Houses of Parliament to the south, and the Portal de
las Damas on the western side. It was erected on the site of
the sumptuous temple dedicated to <i>Huitzilopochtli</i>, the war god
and the patron deity of the Aztecs, whose altars reeked with
the blood of human hecatombs in every city of the empire.
The first stone for this church was laid in the reign of Philip II.,
and the canonicate of Archbishop Pedro Moya de Contreras.
The foundations, which extended as far as the north side of
the old temple, embracing the whole space now taken up by
the courts, were carried on under the energetic supervision of
Alonzo Perez de Castañeda. The work required for these
foundations, owing to the unsteady, marshy nature of the soil,
was so enormous that in 1615 the walls only rose to some
twenty feet above the ground. Philip III., on being informed
of the difficulties which retarded the work begun by his father,
sent a plan drawn by his own architect, which was to simplify
the original one, and accelerate the completion of the church.</p>

<p>The principal sacristy was finished in 1623; the vaults in
the middle nave were completed between 1623 and 1665. In
1667, the interior of the Cathedral being quite finished, the
inauguration took place. The choir, however, was only completed
in 1730, when the rich and marvellous balustrade, which
divides the choir from the sanctuary, executed by Macao, was
put up. This balustrade, composed of bronze and silver, which
has all the appearance of burnished gold, is most striking in
its general effect.</p>

<p>The expenses of this church (completed in 1791) amounted
to 2,446,000 piastres, or £489,200. Seen from the square, the
edifice has the imposing appearance of churches of the latter
portion of the sixteenth century. The façade, though simple,
is very imposing, and contrasts favourably with the other sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">Pg 25</a></span>
edifices in the city; three doors intervene between Doric columns
and open into the middle and lateral naves. Over the main
door two stories superimposed and ornamented with Doric and
Corinthian pilasters, support a most elegant steeple, crowned by
three statues, representing the theological virtues. On each side,
towers, severe in design, and topped by cupolas, rise to the
height of 78 metres.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> The interior is one mass of gold. The choir,
which is immense, occupies the principal nave, and, by means
of a costly composite gallery, is made to join the main altar,
designed after St. Peter’s in Rome. The two lateral naves,
destined for the congregation, have no choir or seats of any kind,
and Mexican ladies, who are very regular in their attendance at
church, are satisfied with kneeling or sitting on the damp stones
of the pavement, whether from zeal or because it would not be
“good form” not to do so, remains doubtful, whereas it is quite
certain that their delicate constitution demands a less dangerous
practice. The few men who are ever seen in the interior of
a church generally stand; most, however, remain outside talking
to one another, and waiting for the ladies, who on coming out
reward them for their patience by a bewitching look or a graceful
inclination of the head.</p>

<p>Among the works of art possessed by the Cathedral, may be
mentioned a small picture by Murillo, known as the “Virgin of
Belen,” not a good specimen of the great master. The priests
attached to the church look upon it, however, as their most
precious jewel; to this may be added the “Assumption of the
Virgin,” of massive gold, weighing 1,116 ounces; a silver lamp
hanging before the sanctuary, which cost £16,000; the tabernacle
of massive silver valued at £32,000, besides diamonds, rubies,
emeralds, amethysts, pearls, and sapphires in shoals, and a vast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">Pg 26</a></span>quantity of gold and silver vases, representing fabulous sums of
money.</p>

<p>On the wall of the left tower to the west, may be seen the
famous Aztec calendar, found on the 17th December, 1700, whilst
the new esplanade of Impedradillo was being constructed. By
order of the Viceroy it was carefully encased and preserved in
the steeple wall, and has proved to be one of the most precious
monuments of Indian antiquity. Antonio de Gama, in a masterly
treatise, explained the objects to which it was devoted, and poured
a flood of light on the astronomical science of the Aborigines
and their mythology. His work has been criticised, however, by
Valentine of New York, and both are impugned by Chavero
of Mexico, whilst others pass a severe judgment on all three.
So true is it, that archæological, like other questions, are ever open
to hot dispute.</p>

<p>The Sagrario is a huge chapel close to the Cathedral, used
for marriages, christenings, and burial services. The host is
exposed at all times on the altar for the veneration of the faithful.
The Sagrario deserves a passing note, for though vicious in taste,
it has such a wealth of ornamentation and sculpture, as to make
one forget the defects of its style considered as a whole. It
is from the Sagrario that the last sacrament used to be carried
to comfort the rich and powerful, in a gilt carriage, or beneath
a gorgeous daïs, amidst a cortège of priests, who preceded and
followed it, its presence being announced by the ringing of a
silver bell. At its approach the traffic and movement of the
town was suspended; every one, no matter the state of the
weather, humbly knelt down in dust or mud; all were expected
to join the procession and accompany the host to the house of
the dying; the viceroy himself was not exempted from this
formality, and chroniclers tell us that many were the times when
he was thus compelled to head the marching column.</p>

<p>But that was in the good old time, which I am old enough
to have seen, when priests and monks, their heads covered with
huge hats, <i>à la</i> Don Basilio, filled the streets with their portly,
dignified figures, their faces ever open to a smile. That time
has gone by; monks and priests, shorn of their dress and
privileges, have disappeared and become private citizens. The
Church on that occasion was not proceeded against by slow
degrees; the Government, feeling at home in a country peculiarly
religious and Catholic, decreed on the same day the suppression
of all religious communities, the confiscation of their goods, and
the disestablishment of the Church, and though a large majority
mildly protested, nobody cared; not so the monks and priests,
who whirled anathemas and fulminated the <i>excommunicatio maxima</i>
against whomsoever should lend a hand to the demolition of
the convents—nay, even against those who would be found
bold enough to pass through the streets thus opened on ecclesiastical
property. The Leperos, however, engaged in these
demolitions, had recourse to an ingenious device to nullify the
spiritual thunderbolts of their ancient patrons. They bedizened
themselves with amulets, scapularies, and chaplets as a protection
against the wiles of the devil, and thus attired they proceeded gaily
to the destruction of cell and chapel, whilst weeping dueñas,
indignant at being witnesses of such sacrilege, poured out their
unavailing supplications.</p>

<p>The excitement lasted but a week, and the Leperos thought
so little of it that they did not refrain from bearing away to their
housewives the wainscoting of the religious houses, and the newly
made streets were used like any others.</p>

<p>But it will be asked, what of the monks? Most have become
citizens and taken wives, and are now heads of families; some
have gone into exile; whilst others are business men. I have
even met a few, who, having turned Protestants, were employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">Pg 30</a></span>
as guides by the Boston and New York Biblical Missions. As
for the clergy, contrary to the received opinion that on being
deprived of their emoluments and tithes they would be richer
than before, they have become as poor as their vows require,
as humble as they profess, reading their services as heretofore
to crowded congregations, and every one is or seems to be
satisfied.</p>

<p>But to return to our edifices. The Church and Convent
of S. Domingo (Dominick) stands in Custom House Square,
blocked up at all times by carriages, carts, mules, and a motley
crowd. At this point, when <i>pronunciamentos</i> were the rule,
rebels used to take their stand, and sheltered behind the high
steeples of the church, shot at their fellow-citizens lodged on
the azoteas (flat roofs) of the neighbouring houses. They did
their work so often and so well that the desolation of these
cloisters is complete. The pictures which once were their chief
ornament are mostly in holes, and the walls blackened with shot
and powder. S. Domingo has the hardly enviable privilege
of having been the seat of the Inquisition. Here, in 1646,
the terrible tribunal celebrated its first <i>auto-da-fè</i>, when forty-eight
persons were burnt at the stake. These human sacrifices,
which were only abolished at the beginning of this century, were
not better than the revolting practices of the Aztecs, save that
Catholic priests were content to burn their victims without eating
them, but to make up for this they branded them with eternal
infamy.</p>

<p>The Convent of S. Francisco, which at one time extended
over fifteen acres of ground, is situated between the street bearing
the same name and S. Juan de Latran y Zuletta Street. It is
intersected by beautiful cloisters, courts, and gardens, and was
formerly the most important as well as the richest convent in
Mexico: having two churches, the interiors of which were adorned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">Pg 31</a></span>
with gigantic altars of finely-carved gilt wood; three exquisite
chapels, and elegant cloisters covered with pictures, thus
forming one of the most remarkable monuments in Mexico.
But alas! all that wealth is gone, the ruthless hand of democracy
has pulled down cell and chapel; streets run in places once
occupied by its altars; its flower-beds are turned into a nursery-garden,
and its silent cells are tenanted by poor families, whose
women and children fill the air with their shrill and discordant
voices. All that remains is the façade, with its magnificent
gate—a curious mixture of Renaissance pilasters, covered with
figures in high relief, surmounted with composite capitals, divided
by niches adorned with statues, besides a marvellous wealth of
ornamentation, not in the best taste, but highly finished. Their
chief interest, however, lies in their being the work of the Indians,
rather than the production of a Spanish chisel. Indians, according
to Mendieta, were no contemptible artists; “with tools made of
tin and copper, they could cut not only metals, but the hardest
substances. They carved their vessels of gold and silver, with
their metallic chisels, in a very delicate manner. They imitated
the figures of animals, and could mix the metals in such a manner,
that the feathers of a bird, or the scales of a fish, should be
alternately of gold and silver.”</p>

<p>They worked the various stones and alabasters with <i>guijarros</i>
(a tool made of silex and flint), in the construction of their public
buildings, entrances and angles of which were frequently ornamented
with images, sometimes of their fantastic and hideous
deities. Sculptured images were so numerous, that the foundations
of the Cathedral in the Plaza Mayor are said to be entirely
composed of them.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> They also painted from nature, birds, fish,
and landscape, and after their conversion to Christianity, says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">Pg 32</a></span>
Mendieta, they reproduced admirably our images and reredos
from Flanders and Italy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-032.jpg" width="500" height="452" alt="CLOISTER OF THE CONVENT OF LA MERCED." />
<p class="caption">CLOISTER OF THE CONVENT OF LA MERCED.</p></div>

<p>The religion of the Aztecs imposed upon their followers
certain forms, in their delineation of the human figure, or the
personification of the Deity, which they were not permitted to
discard; this explains why we find so many rude images side by
side with the most exquisite work of ornamentation.</p>

<p>But to return. No one would stop to look at the Convent
de la <i>Merced</i> were it not for its cloisters, the finest in Mexico;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">Pg 33</a></span>
they are composed of white, slender columns, in Moorish style,
with indented arches, forming galleries which surround a paved
court, the centre of which is occupied by an insignificant
fountain.</p>

<p>The Convent stands in the middle of a densely populated
suburb, forming a striking contrast to the tumult and hubbub
outside. The feeling of profound desolation which is felt at
gazing on these walls is beyond description, for the silence is
only broken in the rare intervals when an <i>aguador</i> comes to
fill his <i>cantaros</i> and <i>chochocoles</i> (earthen pots and jars) at the
fountain. The white picturesque tunic of the monks which
relieved the solitude of these endless galleries has for ever disappeared,
and now its vast passages only give access to empty
cells.</p>

<p>The walls of the galleries are covered with innumerable
pictures, the figures in which are of life-size, representing martyrs
of the order of S. Domingo and its most celebrated saints. They
are not pleasant to look at, presenting to the eye nothing but
distortions, funeral piles and dislocations; all the tortures, in
fact, which the perverted ingenuity of man has devised to harass
his fellow-creatures. Among them, some are lifting to heaven
their gory heads, whose blood is streaming down to their feet,
whilst others are stretching out their freshly-stunted arms and
calcined limbs. At no time can the priests of Huitzilopochtli
have sanctioned more harrowing suffering, or consented, in their
religious frenzy, to more revolting practices.</p>

<p>The Convent de la Merced used to possess a good library,
and many precious manuscripts of Indian antiquity; but the
superstitious ignorance of the monks allowed it to fall into
decay, and documents of highest interest to the historian and
archæologist were used as waste-paper or consigned to the
flames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">Pg 34</a></span></p>

<p>The choir of this church had one hundred seats of carved
oak, and was considered one of the finest in the world. The
Government is converting the church into a library, which,
when completed, is expected to be one of the finest monuments
of the city.</p>

<p>Among buildings of public usefulness, the School of Mines,
El Salto del Agua, Chapultepec Military College, the Art
Academy, and the Museum may be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">El Salto del Agua</span> is the only monumental fountain in Mexico;
it stands in the centre of a low suburb removed from the chief
thoroughfares, and terminates the aqueduct which brings from
Chapultepec (“grasshopper’s hill”) an abundant supply of water
to Mexico. El Salto del Agua is an oblong building, with a
very mediocre façade; a wide spread-eagle in the centre supports
the escutcheon bearing the arms of the city. On each side
twisted columns with Corinthian capitals bear two symbolical
figures, representing Europe and America, besides eight half-broken
vases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">Pg 36</a></span></p>

<p>According to historians of the conquest, El Salto del Agua,
and the Aqueduct which it terminates, replaced the ancient
aqueduct of Montezuma, constructed by Netzahualcoyotl, King
of Tezcuco, between the years 1427 and 1440. At that time
it was brought through an earthen pipe to the city, along a
dyke constructed for the purpose, and that there might be no
failure in so essential an article, a double course of pipes in
stone and mortar was laid. In this way a column of water
the size of a man’s body was conducted into the heart of the
capital, where it fed fountains and reservoirs of the principal
mansions.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Since the name of Netzahualcoyotl has been mentioned, it
may not be out of place to give a brief account of a prince whose
accomplishments, character, and adventurous life, would make
him a fit hero for romance rather than the subject of sober
history. He was descended from the Toltecs, of whom we
shall speak later. He ruled over the Acolhuans or Tezcucans,
as they were generally called, a nation of the same family as
the Aztecs, whom it preceded on the plateau, and whom it rivalled
in power and surpassed in intellectual activity. He was himself
at once king, poet, philosopher, and lawgiver, and was a
munificent patron of letters, and <i>Tezcuco</i> was, in his time, the
meeting-place of all that was intelligent in Anahuac, as was
Athens in the days of Pericles, Florence and Rome under the
Medicis. Netzahualcoyotl held a conspicuous place among the
bards of Anahuac, for the tender pathos of his verse, the elegance
and rich colouring of his style, and the tinge of melancholy which
pervades most of his writings. His large and enlightened mind
could not accept the superstitions of his countrymen, still less
the sanguinary rites of the Aztecs; his humane temper shrank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">Pg 37</a></span>from their cruel rites, and he endeavoured to recall his people
to the more pure and simple worship of their forefathers. But
he shared the fate of men far in advance of their time, and
had to yield before their ignorance and fanaticism, contenting
himself with publicly avowing his faith and nobler conception of
the deity. He built a temple in the usual pyramidal form, to
the “<i>Unknown God, the Cause of Causes</i>.”</p>

<p>Though Netzahualcoyotl was of a benevolent disposition, he
was strict in the administration of the laws, even against his own
children; indeed, he put to death his two sons for having
appropriated other people’s booty. Many anecdotes are told of
the benevolent interest he took in his subjects, amongst whom
he delighted to wander in disguise, and, like Haroun-al-Raschid,
entered freely in conversation with them, thus ascertaining their
individual wants. His last days were spent in the pursuit of
astronomical studies and the contemplation of the future life. He
died full of days after a reign of nearly fifty years, during which
he had freed his country from a foreign tyrant, breathed new life
into the nation, renewed its ancient institutions, and seen it
advancing towards a higher standard of civilisation; and he saw
his end approach with the same serenity that he had shown alike
in misfortune and in prosperity. Such is the very imperfect
account of a prince who was the glory of his nation; whose muse,
by turns, invited men to enjoy the passing hour, or bade them
beware of the vanity of all earthly pleasures, teaching them to
look beyond the grave for things that will endure.</p>

<p>But before we go on to Chapultepec, we must call at Tacuba,
and visit the famous <i>Ahuahuete</i>, a kind of cypress, under whose
shelter Cortez, on the night of July 1, 1520, came to rest his
weary limbs and mourn over the cause which had so greatly
imperilled his safety and that of his troops, as to make imperative
the evacuation of Mexico, in which many of his most trusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">Pg 38</a></span>
veterans were sacrificed. The night was called on this account
<i>Noche triste</i>, “Melancholy night.”</p>

<p class="caption">TREE OF THE NOCHE TRISTE, AT POPOTLAN.</p></div>

<p>But to explain. We will give a short sketch of the causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">Pg 39</a></span>
which brought about this sad event, quoting largely from Father
Duran, Ramirez, and Sahagun:</p>

<p>“It was in the month of May, the Mexican <i>toxcatl</i>, when it
was common for the Aztecs to celebrate their great annual festival
in honour of their war-god <i>Huitzilopochtli</i>, which was commemorated
by sacrifice, religious songs and dances, in which all
the nobility engaged, displaying their magnificent gala costumes,
with their brilliant mantles of feather-work, sprinkled with precious
stones, and their necks, arms, and legs ornamented with collars
and bracelets of gold. Alvarado, whom Cortez had left as
lieutenant of his forces, during his expedition against his formidable
enemy, Narvaez, was now petitioned by the Indian
caciques to be allowed to perform their rites. Alvarado
acquiesced on condition that on this occasion there should be
no human sacrifice, and that they should come without weapons;
he and his soldiers, meanwhile, attended as spectators, some of
them taking station at the gates, as if by chance. They were
all fully armed, but as this was usual, it excited no suspicion;
but as soon as the festival, which was held in the court of the
great temple, had fairly begun, and the Mexicans were engrossed
by the exciting movement of the dance, and their religious chants,
Alvarado and his followers, at a concerted signal, rushed with
drawn swords on their defenceless victims. Unprotected by
armour or weapon of any kind, they were hewn down without
resistance by their pitiless and bloodthirsty assailants. Some fled
to the gates, but were thrust back by the pikes of the soldiers;
some were able to scale the walls; others, penetrating the
sanctuary of the temple, fell on the pavement and simulated death.
The pavement ran with streams of blood, ‘like water in a heavy
shower,’ and the ground was strewn with the mutilated limbs of
the dead. The Spaniards, not content with slaughtering their
victims, rifled them of their precious ornaments. On this sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">Pg 40</a></span>
day were sacrificed more than six hundred men, the flower of
the Mexican nobility; not a family of note but had to mourn
the loss of a near relation. The tidings of this horrible butchery
filled the nation with stupefaction and dismay; they could hardly
believe their senses. Every feeling of long-smothered hostility
and rancour now burst forth in a cry for vengeance. The respect
for the person of their sovereign made them desist from further
attempts to storm the fortress. But they threw up works around
the Palace to prevent the Spaniards from getting out. They
suspended the market, to preclude the possibility of their enemy
obtaining supplies. This accomplished, they quietly sat down,
waiting for the time when famine would deliver the hated foreigner
into their hands. The situation of the Spaniards seemed desperate,
when they were relieved from their gloomy apprehensions by the
return of Cortez, who with his comrades had succeeded in utterly
crushing Narvaez. It was not too soon: a few days more and
the garrison must have surrendered from lack of provisions, and
still more from want of water. Alvarado was subjected to a
cross-examination by Cortez, who contented himself with
administering some words of reproof, and ordering him to his
post; for the city again rose to arms. In this terrible strait,
Cortez sent to the Aztec Emperor to request him to mediate
with his subjects. Meanwhile the Spaniards endeavoured to
effect a retreat out of a city thoroughly roused against them.
This they accomplished under cover of a dark, drizzling night,
after a fearful carnage and much bloodshed, lasting over several
days; when the Spanish troops, accompanied by their Tlascalan
allies, abandoned a city which had been so lately the scene of
their triumphs, and each soldier, loaded with as much gold and
jewels as he could carry, made for the gates. All was hushed in
silence; no danger seeming to arrest their march, they were
beginning to hope that a few hours would see them beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">Pg 41</a></span>
missiles of the enemy. But, as they drew near the bridges of
Tlascopan Street, they were assailed by thousands of Mexicans,
and amidst a fearful tumult and destructive confusion, followed
by shouts of impotent rage from the combatants and moans from
the severely wounded, in which the best among the Spaniards
lay buried in the murky waters of the canals, or fallen under the
axes of the Mexicans, the Spanish leaders, followed by the
disordered remnant of their troops, were allowed to defile to an
adjacent village called <i>Popotla</i>, where Cortez, on beholding their
thinned ranks and deplorable condition, gave vent to the anguish
of his soul.</p>

<p>Cortez’ fame has been much overrated; he was fortunate rather
than great, for he was powerfully assisted at the very outset by
the friendly attitude of the Indians, who welcomed in him the
Deliverer long foretold in their legends, who was to rescue them
from the thraldom and heavy burdens imposed upon them by the
Aztec monarchs, to enable them to carry on their warlike enterprises
and policy of annexation. He was helped, moreover, by
two intelligent interpreters, Aguilar and Marina, in his intercourse
with the natives; Marina proving subsequently a devoted friend,
and a faithful and skilful negotiator with the Indians. It is
equally certain that, from purely selfish motives of personal convenience
and policy, as also to gratify the cruel rapacity of his
followers, he not only allowed, but even ordered acts of bloodshed
and treachery which must for ever stain his character. His
courage cannot be doubted; yet his conduct in the expedition to
Honduras, his pusillanimity on his return, argue a poor politician;
whilst the revolting massacres at Cholula and Mexico sink into
shade when compared with the murder of Guatemozin. Las Casas,
who knew him well, calls him “that fellow;” which term of
reproach is more opprobrious than a worse epithet.</p>

<p>But these things have detained us too long already; let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">Pg 42</a></span>
now proceed to Chapultepec, one of the most delightful spots
in the Mexican valley. Two roads, the Paseo Nuevo and the
tramway, lead to it; we will take the latter as shorter and cheaper,
which, starting from the Place d’Armes, goes through Belen gate,
and sets us down at the very entrance of the Castle. Chapultepec,
“grasshopper hill,” is a volcanic hill some 1,625 feet long, and
100 feet high, covered with luxurious vegetation, crowned with
groves of cypresses, <i>ahuahuetes</i>, some of which are seventy-five
feet in diameter, and seem to defy the decay of ages.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The view from the windows of the Palace, which stands on
the top of the hill, embracing the valley of Mexico, is one of
the finest in the world. In the highly rarefied atmosphere of
these upper regions, even distant objects have a brilliancy of
colouring and a distinctness of outline which enables one to
take in the details of this marvellous panorama, studded with
towns and hamlets, the white walls of which, together with the
tops of porphyry rocks, glimmer in the rays of the sun. Stretching
far away at their feet are seen noble forests of oak, sycamore, and
cedar, whilst beyond, cultivated fields, beautiful gardens, lakes,
and lagoons, girdle the valley around. Looking towards Mexico,
the spectator has behind him the low chain de las Cruces; on his
right, to the south, Pedregal and the Ajuscean hills; before him,
to the east, the grand snowy tops of Popocatepetl, “the hill
of smoke,” and Iztaccihuatl, “White Woman,” from its bright
robe of snow; on his left to the north, Cerro Gordo, and nearer,
the Sierra Guadalupe, where stands the most celebrated sanctuary
of Mexico, dedicated to the Virgin.</p>

<p>This chapel rises on the site once occupied by the famous
temple of Toci—the mother of a god—whose altars were thronged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">Pg 43</a></span>all times by multitudes of devotees. To induce the Indians
to welcome the Virgin Mary as their tutelar divinity, the priests
took care to represent her with a dark complexion and the courtly
robes worn by noble Mexican maidens in their time of prosperity.
The story of the Aztec Virgin is so characteristic of the sanguinary
instincts of the people who raised her to the rank of a deity, that
we will tell it.</p>

<p>The Mexicans, after a series of wanderings and adventures,
during which they endured all the hardships of a migratory life,
succeeded at length in establishing themselves on the muddy
islets of the principal lake, in the year 1325. Here they raised
a temple to their war-god, Huitzilopochtli, on whose altars
human sacrifices were offered. Prisoners were generally reserved
for this purpose, but in times of public calamity the god required
the best of the land. It is told how on one occasion, the oracle
of Huitzilopochtli demanded that a Royal Princess should be
sacrificed to him; and how the Aztec monarch sent to one of
his vassals, the King of Colhuacan, to petition for one of his
daughters to become the mother of the tutelar god—and as such
share with him divine honours. The King of Colhuacan,
flattered by the honour reserved for his daughter, unable besides
to refuse, confided the young Princess to the care of the Aztec
envoys, who escorted her with great pomp to the city where
she was sacrificed, her skin being taken off after death to clothe
the young priest who was to represent the deity in this solemnity.
The cruelty was carried so far as to invite the father to be
present at the bitter mockery of his child’s deification; he came,
penetrated the sanctuary, but at first the gloom of the temple
did not let him see anything, until he was given a copal-gum
torch, the flame of which bursting up suddenly revealed the
horrible picture of the young priest standing close to the idol
and receiving the homage of the multitude. The skin fitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">Pg 44</a></span>
so tightly that the monarch recognised his daughter’s mask, and
almost mad with grief he fled the temple to mourn for his
murdered child.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The Mexican valley was occupied successively by various tribes,
which advancing from the north and north-west, entered the country
towards the end of the seventh century. The first and most
remarkable of these, both from the mildness of their character
and the degree of their civilisation, were the Toltecs, who occupied
Chapultepec as early as the eighth century, and established
their capital at <i>Tula</i>, north of the Mexican valley, whose name
<i>Toltec</i> was synonymous with architect. After a time, a rude tribe,
the <i>Chichemecs</i>, entered the territory and were soon followed by
other races, amongst which were the <i>Aztecs</i> or <i>Mexicans</i>, and
the <i>Acolhuans</i> or <i>Tezcucans</i>. Some of these obtained leave from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">Pg 45</a></span>Xolotl, King of the Chichemecs, to settle on Chapultepec, which
in the course of time became a royal residence, and a royal burial-place,
whilst its rocks were made to transmit to posterity the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">Pg 46</a></span>
features of the Mexican monarchs, Azayacoatl and the two
Montezumas, together with the sons of the last Aztec emperor;
two statues of this monarch and his father were to be seen as
late as the last century, when they were destroyed by order of
the Government.</p>

<p>Father Duran tells how Montezuma I. had himself and
his first minister sculptured. Feeling that his end was drawing
near, he summoned the doughty warrior Tlacael, who for
three reigns had shown his valour on the field of battle and
his wisdom in council: “Brother Tlacael,” said the monarch,
“it would be well that our names and persons should be graven
on the rock of Chapultepec, and thus pass to posterity.” “Your
wish, most noble king, shall instantly be obeyed.” And calling
together the most renowned sculptors, Tlacael imparted to them
the royal command. In a few days two bas-reliefs were executed,
so striking in resemblance, and so exquisite in workmanship, as
to surprise Montezuma himself.</p>

<p>The Castle, which was built by the Viceroy Galvaez at the
close of the seventeenth century, was transformed into a Military
School by the Government in 1841; Maximilian during his short
reign altered it, and made it his favourite residence. The Palace
is once more occupied by the Military College, whose pupils
have shown themselves worthy of it, by their heroic defence at
the time of the American war. An observatory has been lately
built, at the expense of the Government.</p>

<p>But it is time to return to Mexico, where we shall find the
Indian pretty much what he was three or four hundred years
ago. This arises from his having been subjected, from the
earliest times, to Aztec rule and the severe discipline of its priests
and afterwards to the still more cruel and unjust yoke of the
Spaniards, who, by depriving him of civil rights and all his
goods, degraded him to the low rank he now occupies. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">Pg 47</a></span>
the conquest the people was divided in three distinct and almost
equally honourable classes, land proprietors, warriors, and
merchants; but the conquerors, reserving for themselves all
these good things, restricted the Indians to the occupations of
<i>macehual</i> (tiller of the ground), or <i>tamene</i> (porter), that is, a
beast of burden, used by marching armies or merchants in
their distant expeditions; and, although all careers are now
opened to him, he is slow to avail himself of his newly-acquired
privileges.</p>

<p>As an <i>aguador</i>, he still conveys water to every household, in
jars, which he carries one behind, the other in front, supported
by leather thongs covering his head; as a vendor he brings coals
in nets made of aloe strings; his earthenware, poultry, eggs,
vegetables, in <i>huacales</i> or cases made of twigs, kept together by
strings; and, indeed, his tools, kitchen utensils and the like, are
the same as he formerly used. The only alteration he has made
in his costume has been to adopt nether garments, but in the
Uplands he dispenses with this and is satisfied with his <i>maxtli</i>,
“broad band.” He has not varied his diet, nor the manner of
preparing it; the staple of his food is still Indian corn, which he
grinds with a <i>metate</i>, granite roller, or bakes into flat cakes,
<i>tortillas</i>, in <i>comals</i>, or baking ovens. His vegetables he seasons
highly, and on days of festival he adds to this simple fare a turkey
when he is well-to-do, a piece of pork when poor; his drink is
the <i>pulque</i>, the invention of which dates nearly four hundred
years back; his <i>jacal</i>, or hut, composed of sticks lined with clay,
roofed with aloe leaves, measuring at the basement some seven
or ten feet square, is exactly the jacal of ancient chroniclers,
without any pavement, hardly any furniture, save some few images
of saints, which have replaced the terra-cotta household divinities.</p>

<p>In former times, when he lived on the lagoons, with no right
to the land, which was held by his enemies, he satisfied his hunger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">Pg 48</a></span>
with frogs and serpents, to be found in the marshes, salamanders,
flies and flies’ eggs, <i>ahuatli</i>, which latter were made into cakes, a
dish which was adopted by the Spaniards; and, when further
pressed by want and dearth, he invented <i>chinampas</i>, those floating
gardens which so much surprised the conquerors. Chinampas
were rafts of reeds, rushes, and other fibrous materials, which,
tightly knit together, formed a sufficient basis for the heaps of
black mud which the natives drew up from the bottom of the
lake. Gradually islands were formed, some reaching two or
three hundred feet in length, and three or four feet in depth, with
a very rich soil, on which the thrifty Indian raised maize and
vegetables for himself and flowers for the market, his prince, and
his gods. Some of these chinampas were firm enough to allow
the growth of small trees, and to have a hut for the owner, who,
with a long pole resting on the sides or the bottom of the shallow
basin, could change his position at pleasure, whether to move
from an unpleasant neighbour or take his family on board, and
moved on like some enchanted island over the water. In later
times these floating gardens increased to such an extent that they
completely girdled the city around with flowers and verdure, when
every morning early numbers of boats, richly freighted, would be
seen to glide through the canals and file out towards Plaza
Mayor.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Mexico, since the diminution of the lake, has become
a high and dry city of the main land, with its centre nearly a
league distant from the water; chinampas are no more; small
flower-beds, divided by narrow causeways, where the Indian still
mans his canoe, are all that remain of the floating gardens of
olden time. Should the traveller wish to study the natives, he
should go on market days toward the road which leads out of
S. Cosme, by which great numbers both of men and women enter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">Pg 49</a><br /><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">Pg 50</a><br /><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">Pg 51</a></span>the city, their legs and backs bent under burdens heavier sometimes
than an animal could carry. Indian women wear a dark
woollen petticoat, striped with yellow, red, and green, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">Pg 52</a></span>
piece of the same stuff, with an opening for the head, covers the
bust and completes the costume. Notwithstanding their rags,
some are not wanting in good looks, whilst most are well made,
and were they cleanly and better dressed, many would be found
strikingly pretty.</p>

<p>I only speak of young girls, for the old, covered with dirt
rather than rags, are generally to be seen reeling under the
influence of pulque. It is not too much to say that the Indian
has retained all his primitive vices, and has added thereto those
given him by his conquerors. Though he still preserves some
of his popular legends, it is quite a chance if he understands
anything about them; for in olden times, these were kept and
transmitted by the upper classes, which have long ceased to
exist, and the modern Indian knows absolutely nothing of his
past history.</p>

<p>And here, to illustrate my meaning, I may be permitted to
give an example of this marvellous ignorance, even regarding
recent events. I happened to be in a village situated on Lake
Chalco, when a number of Indians of both sexes, dressed up in
old, ludicrous European costumes, got into boats and landed a
short distance further, entering the village amidst a population
which came out to meet them, with cries, hootings and blows,
finally forcing them to re-embark. It was evident to me that this
represented an invasion, which had been successfully repulsed,
referring perhaps to the war of intervention, but though I asked,
no one was able to enlighten me, contenting themselves with
repeating “Francia, Francia.” At last an old man said that
the masquerade commemorated an incident in the Spanish
war of 1808, during the first empire. And on my expressing
my astonishment at the ignorance of the actors about
a subject they represented every year: “Are your common
people much wiser when they sing their Latin Mass?” objected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">Pg 53</a></span>
my American friend. I felt that I was answered, and I was
silent.</p>

<p>The Indian is fond of money, his delight is to hoard, yet he is
no better for it, as regards his daily life; he has all the instinct of
a miser without its benefit; for your miser enjoys his money, he
visits it by stealth, spends his time in counting, in contemplating
it, whereas the Indian buries his hoardings out of sight; the
satisfaction of knowing that he is rich is all-sufficient for him, and
he does not care for the things which his gold would procure.
The Valley of Oaxaca, which for generations supplied the world
with cochineal, is supposed to have millions of money buried
underground. During my residence there, I knew a man who,
it was rumoured, was fond of hoarding; on one occasion he
received some £200 for ingots and cochineal, and two days after
asked me for the loan of four shillings. “Well, but what have
you done with the money you got two days since?” I asked.
“Esta colocado, Señor.” “It’s invested” (stowed underground).
This secretive instinct, however, is not confined to the Indian, it
is to be found among all conquered and persecuted races: serfs
under Louis XIV. hid away both their bread and their money;
the inhabitants of Indo-China and others only pay their taxes
under pressure of the stick. It may be that the thrifty habit of
our own middle classes, their wish to hoard for the mere sake of
it, their aversion to part with it for any purpose of public good,
which forms such a striking contrast to our Transatlantic fellow-citizens,
is attributable to this instinct, which still survives when
the need for it has long ceased to exist. We are, alas, but the
freedmen of yesterday, whereas Americans have now long enjoyed
the blessings of free institutions, and have besides the enormous
advantage of trying them in an entirely new country. Untrammelled
alike by traditions or the bonds which still fetter us, they
are able to work out their benevolent or brilliant schemes, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">Pg 54</a></span>fident
that their intelligence and their industry will lead them to
new paths of progress and prosperity.</p>

<p>With the Indian this same instinct borders on fanaticism:
the man who finds a treasure covers it up again carefully, not
dreaming of making use of it; should he have a confidant, the
latter will starve, nay, go through torture, rather than betray
his friend. And here I cannot resist the temptation of telling
an anecdote related to me by a Mexican friend bearing on the
subject: A well-to-do Indian, who lived not far from Mexico,
had a daughter whom a Frenchman was willing to marry, in
the hope of inheriting the old man’s fortune, which was supposed
to amount to some £20,000. Like most Indians, he died intestate,
when a search was made for his money, but none
could be found. His only available property was his cottage
and garden. The deceased was known to have had a wretchedly
poor friend, the confidant of all his secrets. He was immediately
applied to, and subjected to numerous questions by the heirs
regarding the money, and to induce him to speak, they offered
the quarter, nay, the half of the hidden treasure, but he still
refused; at last they thought of making him drunk, hoping that
what they had been unable to obtain would be effected by pulque.
He was made comfortable, when he became very confiding, so
confiding that the expectant heir fully believed that a moment
more would see him the happy recipient of the long-treasured-up
secret, but the poor man suddenly stopped, horrified at what
he was going to say, seeming to see his friend’s ghost before
him, reproaching him for his disloyalty.</p>

<p>We shall not be taking leave of the Indian if we pay a
visit to the Museum, where Aztec pottery, Aztec jewellery, Aztec
kings, and Aztec gods will remind us of him everywhere. The
Mexican Museum cannot be called rich, in so far that there is
nothing remarkable in what the visitor is allowed to see. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">Pg 55</a></span>
reading the glowing accounts regarding Mexican manufacture
and their marvellous objects of art, it was natural that I should
be anxious to see the jewels, stuffs, manuscripts, and above all
the paintings made with birds’ feathers, representing domestic
scenes, and the portraits of Aztec monarchs, but I saw nothing
in the two large rooms devoted to Mexican antiquities. I was
told that the Museum was not in working order, that nothing
was classified, that more space was being prepared in which
the precious objects now shut up in numerous cases would be
laid out for the benefit of the public. It may be so. For the
present, we have to content ourselves with a collection of obsidian,
marble, and porphyry heads; a number of large yokes, beautifully
carved, besides several pieces of jade, rock-crystal, and bars of
gold. As for the long rows of so-called “ancient vases,” there
is not one that is not imitation. This I know to my cost, for
with a credulity which subsequent events hardly justified, I no
sooner was told that these vases were of great antiquity, than
I immediately ordered three hundred to be cast from them, which
I caused to be placed in the Trocadéro during the Paris Exhibition;
but on an expert in such matters seeing them, he at
once detected and exposed the fraud, and in my disappointment
it was not much comfort to reflect, that with half the money
expended on these comparatively worthless objects, I might
have bought, close to Mexico, a whole collection of vases of
undoubted antiquity. It is a curious circumstance, that Mexicans,
even the best informed among them, as well as foreigners, should
so often be victimised by vulgar forgers of antiquities, who trade
on the passions of the collector and the gullibility of the public;
and that such things cannot be done in Europe without immediate
detection, can only arise from the superior knowledge of our
savants, and the greater facility afforded them of observing, classifying,
and comparing the productions of all the civilised nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">Pg 56</a></span>
of the world, in the numerous collections with which our museums,
both public and private, abound. In my own case, after my excavations,
I never could have been so grossly imposed upon
by pottery modern in shape, over which ancient bas-reliefs had
been incongruously reproduced, forming a monstrous medley
of things old and new, without any originality whatever. Their
history is this: the manufacture was carried out on a large scale
at Tlatiloco, a Mexican suburb, between 1820 and 1828, and
the author must have realised an enormous fortune, if we are
to judge from the quantity which he sent broadcast into the world—most
museums, nearly all private collections are infested with
them, whilst a great number are even now bought by the unwary.
The thing was done in this way. Vases of every shape were
chosen, without much thought or care, relying on the ignorance
and the stupidity of the public; every form was used, whether
a common water-jug, a flat or round vase, a rude or shapely
jar, and by means of ancient moulds found in vast quantities
in the whole area of the valley, heads, images, tiny figures,
whistles, geometrical designs, palm-leaves, etc., were inlaid on
the object, which had a simple, double, or treble twisted handle
according to its size; it was a tripod with a gaping mouth, or
topped with arabesque, when the occasion served. Variety was
its distinctive merit; and when completed this fine work of art
was buried some twelve months or more to impress upon it
the hand of time, and thus prepared was launched on its
course.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">COURT IN THE MEXICO MUSEUM.</p></div>

<p>I trust that these few observations will serve as a warning
to people, and save them from experience as costly as my
own. Having now relieved my conscience, we will go back to
the Museum and look at what I consider the finest portion,
namely the court, planted with beautiful palm-trees, shrubs, and
flowers, amongst which may be seen the most interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">Pg 57</a><br /><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">Pg 58</a><br /><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">Pg 59</a></span>specimens of the whole collection. First and foremost is a
statue of a man lying on his back, holding a cup with both
hands and pressing it against his body. It was found at Chichen-Itza,
in Yucatan, by Leplongeon, an American explorer, who
was obliged to part with it in favour of the Mexican Government,
in virtue of the law which declares all antiquities to be national
property. Next to this in interest come two other statues, like
it in all respects: one discovered at Tlascala, the other marked
“unknown.” This similarity of objects of art found among the
populations of the plateaux and those of the Yucatan peninsula
seems to point to identity of worship among those tribes.
Sanchez, the director of the Museum, believes this statue to be
Tetzcatzoncatl, god of wine; but Perez and Dr. Hamy are of
opinion that it represents Tlaloc, god of rain, in which view I
coincide. However that may be, we will speak of it at greater
length when we come to Chichen-Itza, where it was unearthed.
On the second plan, to the left, stands the Tlascalan Tlaloc, and
behind it Quetzalcoatl, “the feathered serpent,” tutelar deity of
the Toltecs, and worshipped by all American tribes; he came
to have many names, and was represented under various forms,
according to his multifarious attributes. He was the Zoroaster
of Anahuac; “under him the earth produced fruits and flowers
of its own accord. An ear of Indian corn was as much as a
man could carry. The air was filled with perfumes and the
sweet melody of birds,” etc.</p>

<p class="caption">THE STONE OF THE SUN, OR OF TIZOC, MEXICO MUSEUM.</p></div>

<p>At the extremity of the court, to the left, we find a block of
serpentine with a magnificent head beautifully sculptured, marked
in the catalogue as “the rising moon,” but which Bustamente
thinks to be Temascaltoci, the goddess who presided over ablutions,
and Chavero, one of the many forms under which Quetzalcoatl
was represented. In the same line with these stands a huge
block, having a hideous figure of Death, Teoyaomiqui (a goddess)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">Pg 60</a></span>,
besides a vast number of divinities, ranging over the whole
Indian Olympus, collected under the gallery at the furthest
extremity of the court, most of which are frightful, and would
give a poor idea of Aztec talent, did we not know that they
are all specimens of hieratic art, and as such were not permitted
to vary in shape or design. And now we come to <i>Tizoc’s</i> stone,
or <i>Temalacatl</i>, the sun’s stone, one of the most interesting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">Pg 61</a></span>
the collection, and connected with a bloody episode which is
reported by most historians. It would have been broken up
for paving the square, like many other monuments of this kind
found on the same spot and about the same time, had not Canon
Gamboa arrested the work of destruction, and caused the stone
to be placed in the north-west side of the churchyard, where
it was left undisturbed until 1824, when it was transferred to
the University for a short time, and finally placed in the middle
of the court of the New Museum. This monument is a block
of trachyte, oblong in shape, measuring over eight feet in diameter,
thirty-one feet in circumference, and some two feet six
inches in depth. The surface is ornamented with two figures,
portrayed in fifteen different attitudes, recalling the victories
of the Emperor Tizoc. Two women are seen among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">Pg 62</a></span>
vanquished, from which it would appear that the Salic Law was
not in force among the Indians. In every one of these groups
Tizoc is represented holding by the hair the vanquished,
who, in a supplicating posture, seems to ask for mercy. Over
each figure may be seen a hieroglyph, expressive of the
conquered city represented by her chief. The surface of the
stone is occupied by an image of the sun, having in the
centre a hole some six inches deep, which is connected with
a tube terminating on the upper circumference. This hole is
supposed to have been made by the Spaniards in their attempt
to split the stone, which was so fortunately stopped by Canon
Gamboa, but not before they had mutilated every face of the
different groups. This supposition seems borne out by the
fact that it was not likely the original makers would have bored
a hole right through the bassi-relievi, and thus deface their
own work.</p>

<p>The <i>Temalacatl</i>, or “gladiatorial stone,” as it was called by
the Spaniards, must not be confused with the <i>Techcatl</i>, or “stone
of sacrifice.” The former was always to be found in the courts
of the Temple, placed over a basement varying in bulk according
to the size of the stone, from which the captive, particularly
if he happened to be a man of distinction, was allowed to fight
against a number of enemies in succession; but, besides the inequality
of numbers, he was furnished only with a wooden sword
ornamented with feathers along the blade, whereas his adversaries
had weapons of obsidian, “as sharp as steel.” If he succeeded
in defeating them all, as did occasionally happen, he was allowed
to escape, but if vanquished he was dragged to the stone, the
upper surface of which was somewhat convex to receive the
victim; on this the prisoner was stretched, five priests securing
his head and his limbs, while a sixth, clad in a scarlet mantle,
dexterously opened the breast of the victim with a sharp knife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">Pg 63</a></span>
and inserting his hand in the wound, tore out the heart, and
holding it up first towards the sun—a god common to all—cast it
at the face or the feet of the divinity to whom the temple was
dedicated, whilst the multitudes knelt in humble adoration at
the foot of the stone or pyramid ready to receive the body, which
was hurled down by the priests, and which the people divided
among themselves, to have it served up in an entertainment in
honour of the particular god they were celebrating.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">THE TEMALACATL, OR GLADIATORIAL STONE, FROM RAMIREZ MS.</p></div>

<p>The sacrifice ceremonial, whether from the summit of the
Temple or from the gladiatorial stone, was exactly the same,
save that the latter, standing but a few feet from the ground,
allowed the whole city to witness the ghastly details of the sight.
These stones were perfectly plain or beautifully sculptured, like
the one under notice, according to the teocalli it was destined
for, or the degree and importance of the donor. The temalacatl
or stone of Montezuma I., which up to the present time has not
been found, is supposed to lie buried under the “Plaza de las<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">Pg 64</a></span>
Armas” in Mexico. Besides these, there was a smaller circular
stone, the <i>Cuauhxicalli</i>, “eagle’s cup,” so called from the hearts
of the victims being thrown into the hole situated in the centre,
and which now, by a curious contrast, is used as a drinking
trough by pigeons and small birds.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>The last Montezuma would have also erected a Temalacatl,
for which a huge block of stone was transported from Aculco,
beyond Lake Chalco, but in crossing a bridge which traversed
one of the canals, the supports gave way, and the gigantic mass
was precipitated into the water, where it still lies.</p>

<p>A military point of honour, as understood among the western
nations of Europe, was so deeply rooted in the Indian warriors
that they would suffer death rather than be guilty of any act
that could lower them in the estimation of their fellow-citizens.
With the Mexicans and Tlaxcaltecs, a soldier, if unfortunate
enough to be made a prisoner, was reserved for sacrifice, especially
if he happened to be of superior rank; to be ransomed was
deemed unworthy and a disgrace. A few years before the
arrival of the Spaniards, the Uexotzincas, the Tlaxcaltecs and
the Mexicans were at war with each other. In one of the frequent
skirmishes between the rival nations, it happened that a Tlaxcaltec
chief, by name Tlahuicole, was captured. His fame as a warrior
had spread far and wide; his prowess was so well known that
few cared to measure their strength with his, or feel the weight
of his huge tomahawk, which a man of common stature could
hardly lift. But one day, in the heat of pursuit, he got far ahead
of all his companions, when he was waylaid in a morass,
immediately surrounded, placed in a cage, and conveyed to
Mexico amidst the rejoicings of the enemy. He was brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">Pg 65</a></span>to the Emperor Moteuhçoma, who, on hearing his name, not
only spared his life but offered him his liberty, and treated him
with marked distinction. But Tlahuicole refused everything, and
besought the Emperor to devote him to the gods according
to custom. Seeing that he could not be prevailed upon to accept
any offer, however brilliant, Moteuhçoma gave orders that he
should be tied on the gladiatorial stone and that some of his
best soldiers should fight him, whilst he himself, with a numerous
retinue, witnessed the scene. Tlahuicole killed successively eight
men, and wounded upwards of twenty; but he succumbed at
last, and was carried off to be offered to the war-god Huitzilopochtli.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>But to return: this temalacatl clearly belongs to Tizoc, for
his portrait is seen on the edge of the stone, whilst a speckled
leg (he is supposed to have had varices) is sculptured above his
image. The monument, however, like the great temple, may
have been completed by his successor Ahuitzotl between 1484-1486.</p>

<p>Human sacrifices were made even more revolting by cannibalism,
which from the Aztecs spread among all the surrounding
nations, and were adopted by the populations with which they
were at war by way of reprisals. The more humane chiefs, such
as Netzahualcoyotl, king of Texcuco, tried to oppose this
barbarous custom; but they were obliged to yield before the
ignorance of the people and the fanaticism of the priests, who
seeing that the supply of prisoners of war began to fail, clamoured
for more, and urged on the monarchs the necessity of sacrificing
their own subjects, on the ground that they would be more easily
obtained; that they would be fresher, more acceptable, and in the
same condition as children and slaves. In the year 1454, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">Pg 66</a></span>country was visited by a horrible famine, and the priests declared
that the celestial wrath could only be appeased by regular and
numerous sacrifices; to obtain which a treaty was entered into by
the three allied kings of Mexico, Texcuco, and Tlacopan with the
three republics of Tlascala, Huezotzinco, and Cholula, by which
they agreed that their troops should engage to fight on the first
days of each month, on the territory between Cuantepec and
Ocelotepec, and thus supply themselves with human victims. The
men engaged in these encounters received the terrible name of
“enemies of the house,” whilst these monthly affrays are known in
history as the “Holy War.” It was not on the circular Temalacatl
that victims were sacrificed, but on the dreadful <i>Techcatl</i>,
“stone of sacrifice,” which was 6 ft. 6 in. long by 3 ft. 3 in. wide,
and about 3 ft. high, so as to enable the officiating priests to have
a thorough command over their victim. At the dedication of the
great temple of Huitzilopochtli in 1486, the prisoners who for
some years had been reserved for this solemn occasion, were
drawn up and ranged in files, forming a procession along the
narrow causeways two miles long, when the number sacrificed
is almost beyond belief, and is variously estimated at 80,000 and
20,000. The massacre lasted four days, and was begun by the kings
of Mexico, Texcuco, Tacuba, and the Minister Tlacael, until they
were relieved by the priests. However, the number of victims
immolated has no doubt been much exaggerated.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to reconcile these revolting usages with a people
that had made great advance in civilisation. American writers
have tried to palliate the abominable practices of their ancestors,
on the ground that they shared them in common with every other
nation in the early stage of their history. In their eyes the
Aztecs, if not commendable, were at least pardonable, and Orozco
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">Pg 67</a></span>y Berra says that “human sacrifices originate from an error of the
mind rather than from evil disposition; that it is the result of an
exaggerated religious feeling, and not a real desire to do evil.
That this institution, if philosophically considered, is not deserving
of the intempestive lamentations of a few sentimental moralists.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
“The horror I feel,” he adds, “for the revolting abuse of human
sacrifice, yields to what I feel for utter impiety; I will go further,
and say that I prefer human sacrifice to atheism, as I prefer the
ignorant negro who bows before his fetish, to a free-thinker.”
Obviously Orozco is animated with the same spirit as his ancestors.
An Aztec of the olden time would have adduced better reasons,
for he held that to be sacrificed on the altar of his god was even
more glorious than to die in battle, since it ensured him a speedy
passage into paradise; and as the enemy was never slain if there
were a chance of taking him alive, the number of those who
disappeared was a fixed quantity. The same argument is urged
in favour of cannibalism, but it is at least doubtful if it ever existed
as an institution among other civilised nations. Men, however
cruel, do not feed on one another, unless obliged by an absolute
necessity; and cannibalism, which no doubt existed with all primitive
populations, only continued among those who were deprived of
sufficient space where they could hunt and feed their flocks, and
who were reduced to a scanty supply of roots and herbs for their
subsistence. This was observed among the Caraïbs at the time of
the Conquest; in the islands of the Pacific, in Australia, where the
soil is so poor, that although cannibalism prevails, the increase of
population has to be kept down, and the recent introduction of
pigs in the islands has diminished but not eradicated this ancient
practice, which has never flourished with races provided with
bears, reindeer, horses, and herds. This usage, which at first was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">Pg 68</a></span>a necessity, became a sacred tradition with the Aztecs, with whom
religion was all-powerful; it directed the State, presided over the
minutest details of domestic life, and as the influence of the priests
was unbounded, peasants and princes had to bow their necks to
their tyranny. They cannot be called cannibals, however, in the
coarsest sense of the word, for they did not feed on human flesh
to gratify their appetite, but as a duty, and in obedience to their
religion; and during the long and terrible siege of Mexico not
a single case of cannibalism is recorded against them by ancient
authorities. Whence did they derive this
religious practice? Not from the nations
of the ancient continent with whom they
have so much in common, for at that time
cannibalism was no longer practised among
the nomadic tribes of Eastern Asia; nor
from Japan or China, where the people
had always lived on the produce of the
soil; it is probable that they received it
from the Caraïbs of the Antilles and the
Polynesian races of the Pacific, who made
them forget the mild teachings and higher civilisation of the
Toltecs.</p>

<p>We give the drawings of two yokes: No. 1 is the yoke which
up to the present time has been universally accepted as that used
for securing the victim during the sacrifice, of which several
specimens are to be seen in Mexican museums and in our own
Trocadéro, but which, owing to the cylindrical shape of the arch,
measuring some sixteen inches in height by about seven in width,
we maintain could never have been used for the purpose assigned
to it; whereas No. 2, which we claim to have unearthed, answers
in our opinion exactly to the requirements of a yoke for such
a purpose. It is almost the width of the Techcatl, and is concave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">Pg 69</a></span>
on its lower surface, which makes it a perfect fit for a convex
stone; it has, moreover, a round hollow in the centre, sufficiently
large to steady a man’s neck, so that the priest had only to apply
this yoke to prevent any movement, when, to use Father Duran’s
expression, he let fall his sharp silex knife and the victim opened
“like a pomegranate.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the assertion of most historians respecting the
work of the Aborigines, it is difficult to account how with the tools
they were acquainted with they could cut not only the hardest
substances, but also build the numerous structures which are still
seen in Mexico and Central America, together with the sculptures,
bas-reliefs, statues, and inscriptions like those we reproduce. These
monuments were innumerable, of all dimensions, and according to
Leon y Gama,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> there was no town or settlement which did not
possess on the stones of its walls, on the rocks of its mountains,
the year of its foundation, its origin, and the history of its progress
engraved in symbols and characters which could only be read by
the Indians themselves. It is all the more inexplicable that they
should have only used stone implements, that copper was abundant,
and that they knew how to temper and make it nearly as hard as
steel. The method employed by stone sculptors, however, has in
all probability been lost.</p>

<p>Clavigero<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> says that stone was worked with tools of hard
stone; that copper hatchets were used by carpenters, and also
to cultivate the soil and to fell trees; and Mendieta writes that
both carpenters and joiners used copper tools, but that their work
was not so beautiful as that of the sculptors on stone who had
silex implements.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">Pg 70</a></span></p>

<p>Some historians have proved to their own satisfaction that
copper was unknown to the Indians; but had they taken the
trouble to read, however slightly, any authority on the subject,
they would have paused before they advanced a theory which
is entirely at variance with all writers, both ancient and modern.
It is an ascertained fact that very rich copper-mines have been
worked since the Conquest;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> and in 1873, whilst sinking a shaft
in a copper-mine at Aguila, in the State of Guerrero, the miner
lost suddenly the vein; and on examining the cause of the
accident an excavation was found 4 ft. 4 in. long, 4 ft. 9 in. deep,
and over 3 ft. wide, in which was a rich copper vein from 2 to 4 in.
in thickness. The engineer, Felipe Lorainzar, could see no sign
of iron or powder having been used, but the walls showed marks
of fire; and both the copper ore and the rock in which it was
embedded, were shattered and split in various places. In the
rubbish were found 142 stones of different dimensions, shaped like
hammers and wedges, the edges of which were blunt or broken;
these stones were of a different substance from the surrounding
rock, clearly indicating that the mine had originally been worked
by the natives.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Copper was likewise found in Chili, Columbia, Chihuahua, and
in New Mexico. Before the Conquest, the Indians procured lead
and tin from the mines of Tasco, but copper was the metal used in
mechanic arts. Hatchets, arms, and scissors were made of copper
found in the mountains of Zocatollan. The letters of Cortez tell
us that among the taxes paid by the conquered people, figured
copper hatchets and lingots of the same metal, which were paid
every eighty days. Bernal Diaz<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> says that in his second expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">Pg 71</a></span>with Grijalva, the inhabitants of Goatzacoalco brought them
upwards of six hundred copper hatchets in three days, having
wood handles exquisitely painted, and so polished that “we thought
at first they were gold.” Copper was also found in Venezuela,
where, at the present day, jewels of copper, or mixed with gold,
crocodiles, lizards, and frogs are found. We procured some and
placed them in the Trocadéro, having the same dimensions as
those in Central America. Those we found on our first visit to
Mitla, are thin, shaped like a <i>tau</i>, and hardly 4 in. long. Dupaix
found similar hatchets at Mitla, and he thinks they were used as
currency, a supposition all the more probable, that an Indian from
Zochoxocotlan, near Oaxaca, found an earthen pot containing
twenty-three dozen of these taus, but differing slightly from each
other both in size and thickness. We read in Torquemada,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
that copper tablets, varying in thickness and shaped like a tau,
were used as currency in various regions, and that they contained
a large proportion of gold.</p>

<p>Gumesindo Mendoza mentions copper scissors in the Mexican
Museum which were found to contain 97·87 lead, 100 copper, 213
platinum, 100 tin, and infinitesimal quantities of gold and zinc. On
removing the oxide which covered them the bronze looked like
red gold, its density being equal to 8.815; it is harder than copper
and breaks under strong pressure, the broken part showing a fine
granulation, like steel; but its hardness is less than carburetted
iron and insufficient for the use it was intended for.</p>

<p>Humboldt says that Peruvian scissors contained 94 lead, 100
copper, 6 platinum, 100 tin, and that their specific weight was 8·815;
other scissors analysed by Ramirez yielded 90 lead, 100 copper, 10
platinum, and 100 tin. It seems almost impossible that the Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">Pg 72</a></span>should not have used these admirable bronze scissors to build
palaces, sculpture their idols and the images of their kings, which
are still visible on the porphyry rocks of Chapultepec; and if it is
denied that they were able to carve such hard substances, they
must be credited with having easily worked the calcareous stones
of Chiapas and Yucatan.</p>

<p>The American tribes had reached the transition epoch between
the polished stone and the bronze period, which was marked by
considerable progress in architecture and some branches of science.
With them this period lasted longer than in the old world, owing
to their never having come in contact with nations of a higher
civilisation and possessed of better tools. Their only scientific
data in the past were traditions which, if we believe their apologists,
were carefully preserved and developed; but they have nearly all
been lost, and great uncertainty must for ever rest upon the degree
of their scientific progress; for it is equally impossible to accept
either the wild theories of the good Abbé Brasseur, who sees in the
Troano and Chilmalpoca codices, a whole system of geology dating
ten thousand years back, as it is impossible to accept the childish
dreams of Leplongeon, who credits the Mayas with every discovery
down to the electric telegraph; nor yet those who maintain that
without astronomical instruments (since they were unacquainted
with glass) the Aztecs had discovered the composition of the sun
and the transit of Venus. It seems as futile to make the Nahuas
the inventors of everything as to rank them with mere savages.
The religion of a people is a sure index of the degree of its
culture; we know that the moral code and religion of the Toltecs
showed wonderful growth towards all the essentials of a high
civilisation, for religion in its early stage is but a gross fetishism,
of which the head of the family is the priest, who performs before
his household god the simple ceremonies he learnt from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">Pg 73</a></span>
forefathers. But as the tribe rises in importance his duties become
more complicated, and he is willing to lay down his priestly office
in favour of a poet or prophet, who, whilst the warriors are engaged
in warfare and other avocations, shall pray for the welfare of the
tribe and expound the wishes of the deity, receiving for his services
part of the booty or the produce of the chase, and later, have his
share of the land under cultivation. He soon adopts a dress so as
to be distinguished from the warriors and the people; and as the
number of priests increases, offerings are multiplied; a more imposing
ceremonial replaces the simple worship of former days, temples
and chapels are built, the image of the god is placed in the
sanctuary, and only approached by the high priest, who becomes
the sole interpreter between god and man. The former is now
given numerous personalities, according to his various attributes,
and the simple fetish of an early epoch develops in process of
time into a mighty host, frequently numbering upwards of three
thousand deities like the Aztec Olympus, for whose service a
numerous priesthood and great wealth are required, implying a
high degree of civilisation.</p>

<p>That there should be great uncertainty upon questions resting
chiefly on vague traditions is natural enough, but that the same
should be the case with matters that admitted of easy proof seems
unaccountable; as, for instance, the name of Montezuma, in whose
intimacy the Spaniards lived several months; yet of the twenty-three
chroniclers who wrote about him, two call him Motecuhzoma,
three Montezuma, and the remaining eighteen spell his name in as
many different ways.</p>

<p>And here we will take leave of the Aztecs, whose history has
been so admirably written by Prescott. My object in writing
about them was to give some idea, however slight, of this people,
in order to prepare the reader to follow me in my investigations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">Pg 74</a></span>
respecting the far more ancient civilisation of the Toltecs—a
civilisation which from them passed to the Aztecs, the Nahua
tribes, and the people of Central America; the remains of which
are still to be seen, whilst its stones will compose, together with
chroniclers and historians, the foundation of our work.</p>

<p class="center">TULA.</p>

<p class="indent">Journey to Tula—The Toltecs—Ancient Historians—Origins—Peregrinations—
Foundation of Tula—Toltec Religion—Chief Divinities—Art—Industry—Measurement
of Time—The Word <i>Calli</i>—Architecture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> journey to Tula, capital of the Toltecs, our next destination,
is performed partly by railway and partly by diligence over a
distance of some sixteen leagues north of Mexico. The valley
in this month (August) is at its best; immense plantations of
Indian corn give it the aspect of a green sea, whilst a grand
range of mountains and lofty summits bound it at the horizon.
We go through the Tejan district, stopping a few minutes at
Tacuba, where the old cypress of the “Melancholy night” is
again pointed out to us. Our next station is Atzacapotzalco, once
an independent state; then Tlanepantla. The country, as far
as the eye can reach, presents nothing but the same plantations,
the same hamlets, the same poor squalid huts, whilst here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">Pg 76</a></span>
there a few Indians in tatters, and swarms of naked children,
gaze at us stupidly as we speed along. Now we come to a
fortress-like church, formerly used as a stronghold by the
Pronunciados; we notice for the first time some stunted poplars,
some rare willow-trees, and by-and-by hedges of prickly pear,
and now that we are in the diligence, the country somewhat
changes; instead of long stretches of green maize, we have
immense plantations of aloe, which to my mind, whether viewed
from afar or near, are never a picturesque feature in the landscape.
It is a wonder how we advance at all, for the wheels of our
carriage almost disappear in the ruts of the worst road I ever
travelled upon; I am confident that nothing has been done to
it since the day it was opened. We cross a muddy river, when,
with cracking of whip and galloping horses, we enter a village
shaded by great ash-trees, and draw up before a respectable-looking
inn, where we take up our quarters, for we are in Tula,
once the brilliant capital of the Toltecs, but now reduced to a
small straggling town numbering some 1,500 souls.</p>

<p>The Toltecs, as was stated before, were one of the Nahuan
tribes, which from the seventh to the fourteenth century spread
over Mexico and Central America. Their existence has been
denied by various modern historians, although all American
writers agree that the numerous bands which followed them in
the country received their civilisation from them. It must be
admitted, however, that our knowledge rests chiefly on traditionary
legends full of anachronisms, transmitted to us by the
nations that came after them; but it will be our care to fill up
the enormous discrepancies to be met with at almost every page,
by the monuments it has been our good fortune to bring to
light. Two writers, Ixtlilxochitl and Mariano Veytia, have
written about this people: the first in his “Historia Chichemeca”
and “Relaciones,” the second in his “Historia Antigua de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">Pg 77</a></span>
Mejico;” the latter being more explicit, it is from him that we
will chiefly borrow, without neglecting, however, other chroniclers.
Both made use of the same documents, drew from the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">Pg 78</a></span>
sources, the traditionary legends of their country; and Veytia,
besides his own, had access to Botturini’s valuable collection of
Mexican manuscripts, so that he was well acquainted with
American antiquities. Ixtlilxochitl, on the other hand, as might
be expected, in writing the history of his ancestors, whose
language he understood and whose hieroglyphs he could decipher,
is inspired by patriotic zeal; and it will be found that these
historians have just claims to our admiration for the compass of
their inquiries, and the sagacity with which they conducted them.</p>

<img src="images/illus-077.jpg" width="500" height="665" alt="EXTRACTING PULQUE." />
<p class="caption">EXTRACTING PULQUE.</p></div>

<p>A third writer, Ramirez, by far the most illustrious of those
who have treated the same subject, speaking of the two historians
who preceded him, says: “I am not claiming infallibility for our
historians, yet it must surely be conceded that, if no credence
is given to our own, the same measure must be meted out
to all the traditions of other countries, for neither Diodorus,
Josephus, Livy, Tacitus, nor other historians, are able to bring
the array of documents with which our history abounds in support
of their assertions. I have purposely omitted Herodotus, the
most curious and instructive among ancient historians, because
modern discoveries and modern criticism have cleared him from
the unjust attacks of Plutarch. A history is true and highly
instructive, although it may contain absurd propositions, if it
faithfully transmits the traditions, the belief, and the customs
of a people; as it may be absolutely false, although relating
facts which seem natural and probable, but are only the invention
of the author. Mexican history and biography, like those of
other nations, are founded on tradition and historical documents;
than which none are better authenticated or more trustworthy.”</p>

<p>We think Ramirez proves his case, and, in writing these
chapters, we will not be more critical than he is.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">Pg 79</a></span></p>
<p>Veytia,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> like all historians of that time, places the primitive
home of the Toltecs in Asia, to make his account agree with
Genesis, where it is said that after the destruction of the
Babylonian Tower, “The Lord scattered the sons of men upon
the face of all the earth.” According to him, they crossed
Tartary and entered America through the Behring Straits, by
means of large flat canoes, and square rafts made of wood
and reeds; the former are described, and called <i>acalli</i>, “water
houses,” in their manuscripts. Directing their course southward,
they built their first capital, <i>Tlapallan</i>, “coloured,” subsequently
<i>Huehue-Tlapallan</i>, to distinguish it from a later <i>Tlapallan</i>.
Huehue-Tlapallan was the cradle whence originated the various
tribes which peopled America. Each tribe was called after the
father or chief of the family, who was also its ruler; hence came
the <i>Olmecs</i>, from Olmecatl; the <i>Xicalancas</i>, from Xicalantl, etc.;
it is uncertain whether the <i>Chichemecs</i> derived their appellation
from Cichen, the man, or Chichen, the town in Yucatan.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>The Toltecs, by the common consent of historians, were the
most cultured of all the Nahua tribes, and better acquainted
with the mode of perpetuating the traditions of their origin and
antiquities. To them is due the invention of hieroglyphs and
characters, which, arranged after a certain method, reproduced
their history on skins of animals, on aloe and palm-leaves, or
by knots of different colours, which they called <i>nepohualtzitzin</i>,
“historical events,” and also by simple allegorical songs. This
manner of writing history by maps, songs, and knots, was handed
down from father to son, and thus has come to us.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>Tlacatzin was the next city they built; and here, after thirteen
years of warfare, they separated from the main body of the nation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">Pg 80</a></span>and migrated some seventy miles to the south, where in 604 they
founded Tlapallanco, “small Tlapallan,” in remembrance of their
first capital. But the arrival of fresh immigrants caused them
to remove further south, and, under the command of their wise
man, <i>Hueman</i>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> “the Strong Hand,” who is endowed with <i>power</i>,
<i>wisdom</i>, and <i>intelligence</i>, the Toltecs set out in 607, and marked
their progress by building Jalisco, where they remained eight
years; then Atenco, where they were five years; and twenty years
at Iztachuexuca. In after times other Nahuan tribes followed
them by different routes, as the ruins in New Mexico and the
Mexican Valley everywhere attest.</p>

<p>Las Casas Grandes, the settlements in the Sierra Madre, the
ruins of Zape, of Quemada, recalling the monuments at Mitla,
others in Queretaro, together with certain features in the building
of temples and altars, which remind one of the Mexican manuscripts
from which the Toltec, Aztec, and Yucatec temple was
built, make it clear that the civilising races came from the northwest;
and Guillemin Tarayre,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> like ourselves, sees in the <i>calli</i>
the embryo of the <i>teocalli</i>, which developed into the vast proportions
of the pyramidal mounds found at Teotihuacan, Cholula,
in Huasteca, Misteca, Tabasco, and Yucatan.</p>

<p>The next city built by the Toltecs was Tollatzinco, where
they remained sixteen years; and finally settled at Tollan or
Tula, which became their capital. The date of its foundation
is variously given; Ixtlilxochitl sets it down at 556, Clavigero
667, and Veytia assigns 713 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> as the probable date. In our
estimation, this divergence of opinion confirms rather than
invalidates the existence of this people.</p>

<p>When the Aztecs reached Anahuac, Atzacapotzalco, Colhuacan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">Pg 81</a></span>and Texcuco were small flourishing states. They had inherited
from the Toltecs many useful arts, their code of morals, philosophy
and religion, which in their turn they taught the Aztecs,
so that the institutions and customs of these different tribes
were common to all; and in default of documents which have
been lost, we ascribe nearly all the historians of the Conquest
relate of the Aztecs, whom they found the dominant race, as
applicable to the Toltecs, the fountain of all progress both on
the plateaux and in Central America, where we shall follow
them. As for the Aztecs, who settled for the first time on the
Mexican lake at the beginning of the fourteenth century, they
were at that period nothing but a rude, barbarous tribe, and to the
last day of their political existence they remained a military caste.</p>

<p>Among the ruins to be found at Tula are those of an unfinished
temple called <i>Quetzali</i>, consisting of pillars in the shape of serpents,
the heads of which form the basement and the tails the capital.</p>

<p>Some writers, amongst whom is Botturini, think the Toltecs
were preceded by the Olmecs and Xicalancas on the territories
of Tlaxcala, Huexcotzinco, and Puebla, when, after years of
inter-tribal conflict, they settled in the Yucatan peninsula. But
we have found in several Indian writers, that at the coronation
of <i>Chalchiuhtlanetzin</i>, “bright stone,” King of the Toltecs, the
Olmecs and Xicalancas came to swear allegiance and submit to
his authority; and there is nothing to make one suppose that
they were compelled to leave the country, for they seem to
have amalgamated so well with the new-comers that their very
name was merged in theirs, although they retain the memory
of their origin even to this day. “<i>There can be no doubt</i>,” says
Veytia, “<i>that some of these people</i> (Toltecs) <i>established themselves
in Yucatan</i>”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>—a remarkable passage, which we find confirmed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">Pg 82</a></span>every step. According to the same authority, they built Tula
in six years, when, to avoid the personal jealousy of the
Caciques, they petitioned for the second son of King Huehue-Tlapallan,
whom they proclaimed their ruler under the name
of <i>Chalchiuhtlanetzin</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">TOLTEC POTTERY.</p></div>

<p>All the Toltecs did was excellent, graceful, and delicate;
exquisite remains of their buildings covered with ornamentation,
together with pottery, toys, jewels, and many other objects are
found throughout New Spain, for, says Sahagun,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> “they had
spread everywhere.” Both Veytia and Ixtlilxochitl<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> ascribe
a common origin to the Nahua, Toltec, Acolhuan, and Mexican
tribes. “The Toltecs were good architects and skilled in
mechanic arts; they built great cities like Tula, the ruins of
which are still visible; whilst at Totonac they erected palaces
of cut stone, ornamented with designs and human figures, recalling
their chequered history.” “At Cuernavaca” (probably Xochicalco),
he adds, “were palaces entirely built of cut stone, without mortar,
beams, girders, or wood of any kind.” Torquemada speaks of the
Toltecs in the same terms, observing that “they were supposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">Pg 83</a></span>have come from the west, and to have brought with them maize,
cotton, seeds, and the vegetables to be found in this country;
that they were cunning artists in working gold, precious stones,

Quotations might be multiplied
<i>ad infinitum</i>, but the foregoing
will suffice to prove the existence
of this people and their
peculiar genius.</p>

<p>Their law of succession was
somewhat curious: each king
was to rule one of their centuries
of fifty-two years; if he
lived beyond it he was required
to give up the crown to his
son, and, in case of death, a
joint regency took the reins
of government for the remaining
years. Their sacred book,
<i>teomoxtli</i>, contained both their annals and their moral code. It
is conjectured, with what evidence is uncertain, that they worshipped
an “unknown god,” perhaps the origin of the “unknown
god” to whom the King of Texcuco raised an altar. Their
principal deities, however, were <i>Tonacatecuhtli</i>, the “Sun” and
the “Moon,” to whom temples were first erected; to these they
added <i>Tlaloc</i>, god of rain, and <i>Quetzalcoatl</i>, god of air and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">Pg 84</a></span>wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Tlaloc, according to Torquemada, was the oldest
deity known, for when the Acolhuans, who followed the Chichemecs,
arrived in the country, he was found on the highest summit
of the Texcucan mountain.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> His paradise, called <i>Tlalocan</i>, was
a place of delight, an Eden full of flowers and verdure;
whilst the surrounding hills were called “Tlaloc mounts.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> He
was emphatically the god of many places, of many names, and
numerous personifications; as Popocatepetl he presided over the
formation of clouds and rain, he was the “world-fertiliser,” the
“source of favourable weather,” sometimes represented dark in
colour, his face running with water to signify a rich yielding soil;
he carried a thunderbolt in his right hand, a sign of thunder
and lightning; whilst his left held a tuft of variegated feathers,
emblem of the different hues of our globe; his tunic was blue
hemmed with gold, like the heavens after rain. His wife,
<i>Chalchiuhtlicue</i>, goddess of waters, was represented wearing a
blue petticoat, the colour of the mountain Iztaccihuatl when seen
at a distance, which was sacred to her.</p>

<p>Most historians mention Quetzalcoatl, at first a generic name,
whom posterity endowed with every virtue and deified.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> His
great temple was at Tula, but he was also worshipped in Yucatan
under the name of <i>Cukulcan</i>,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> having the same meaning with
Quetzalcoatl. He had travelled thither with a branch of the
Toltecs, which, advancing from west to east, had taken Tabasco
on their way, and occupied the peninsula earlier than a second
branch, which entered the country by a southern route, under
the command of their chief <i>Tutulxiu</i>, and became the rival
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">Pg 85</a></span>and enemy of the first, whose reigning family were the <i>Cocomes</i>,
“auditors.” The worship of Quetzalcoatl extended on the
plateaux and in the peninsula, where the chiefs claimed to be
descended from him. The symbol by which he is best known
is “feathered serpent;” but he was severally called <i>Huemac</i>,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
the “Strong Hand,” the “white-bearded man,” his mantle
studded with crosses, or dressed in a tiger’s skin; “god of air,”
when he was the companion of Tlaloc, whose path he swept,
causing a strong wind to prevail before the rainy season; and
also a youthful, beardless man, etc. The various attributes of
Quetzalcoatl and Tlaloc developed according to the people, the
country, and epoch. Such transformations have been observed
among all nations: in India the great Agni was at first but the
spark produced by rubbing two pieces of wood together, which
became cloud, dawn, the sun, the flash, Indra, etc. With the
Greeks, Apollo was the god of light, poetry, music, medicine,
etc. The Christian religion presents the same phenomenon;
for we have the Ancient of Days, the Dove, the Lamb, the
Vine. Thus Tlaloc, god of rain, is sometimes seen on ancient
vases, his eyes circled with paper, his face running with water;
or as an embryo cross, a perfect cross; and again in the form
of a man lying on his back, supporting a vase to collect rain.
The latter representation is found in Mexico, Tlaxcala, and
Yucatan. Several writers<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> mention that crosses were found
throughout Mexico, Yucatan, and Tabasco, being another and
later personification of Tlaloc. They have all been lost; but
we reproduce those found by us, presenting various distinct
forms. The <i>cultus</i> of the cross is of great antiquity and almost
universal, for we find it in Greece, in India, on pottery of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">Pg 86</a></span>
Bronze Period (the suastica); whilst among the Slaves it was,
as in America, the god of storm and rain.</p>

<p>The same may almost be said of the serpent.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> It was
reverenced in Egypt, in America, and is found at the beginning
of Genesis; whilst in the north-west of India, the <i>Nagas</i> were
serpent worshippers, whose great ancestor <i>Naga</i> was supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">Pg 87</a></span>to have been present at the Creation as Genius of the Ocean.
He was the god of wisdom, the titular deity of mankind; and
we find him at Bœroe-Bœdor, in Java, beautifully sculptured on
a bas-relief, where Buddha is seen crossing the seas on a lotus-wreath,
whilst close to him two immense serpents (Nagas) are
raising their heads towards him in token of reverence. He is
also worshipped in Cambodia, and his image is reproduced on
the magnificent monuments of Angcor-Tom.</p>

<p>The festival which was celebrated in honour of Quetzalcoatl
during the <i>teoxihuitl</i>, “sacred year,” was preceded by a severe
fasting of eighty days, during which the priests devoted to his
service were subjected to horrible penances. He reigned suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">Pg 88</a></span>cessively
at Izamal, in Yucatan, Chichen-Itza, and Mayapan,
under the name of <i>Cukulcan</i>. To this god were ascribed the
rites of confession and penance.</p>

<p>The religion of the Toltecs was mild, like their disposition;
no human blood ever stained their altars, their offerings consisting
of fruits, flowers, and birds; nevertheless, their laws,
which were the same for all classes, were stringent and severe.
Polygamy was forbidden, and kings themselves were not allowed
concubines, whilst their priests were deserving of the respect
which was shown them from prince and peasant alike. They
had sculptors, mosaists, painters, and smelters of gold and silver;
and by means of moulds knew how to give metals every variety
of shape; their jewellers and lapidaries could imitate all manner
of animals, plants, flowers, birds, etc. Cotton was spun by the
women, and given a brilliant colouring both from animal and
mineral substances; it was manufactured of every degree of
fineness, so that some looked like muslin, some like cloth, and
some like velvet. They had also the art of interweaving with
these the delicate hair of animals and birds’ feathers, which made
a cloth of great beauty. Ixtlilxochitl<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> is afraid to pursue the
panegyric of this people, lest it should appear exaggerated.
Their calendar was adopted by all the tribes of Anahuac and
Central America; it divided the year into eighteen months of
twenty days each, adding five intercalary days to make up the full
number of three hundred and sixty-five days; these belonged to
no month, and were regarded as unlucky. Both months and days
were expressed by peculiar signs; and as the year has nearly six
hours in excess of three hundred and sixty-five days, they provided
for this by intercalating six days at the end of four years, which
formed leap year. <i>Tlapilli</i>, “knots,” were cycles of thirteen years;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">Pg 89</a></span>four of these cycles was a century, which they called <i>xiuhmolpilli</i>,
“binding up of knots,” represented by a quantity of reeds bound
together. Besides the “bundle” of fifty-two years, the Toltecs
had a larger cycle of one hundred and four years, called “a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">Pg 90</a></span>
age,” but not much used. The whole system rested on the
repetition of the signs denoting the years, enabling one by means
of dots to determine accurately to what cycle or what century each
year belonged. And as these signs stood differently in each cycle,
confusion was impossible; for the century being indicated by
a number showing its place in the cycle, the dots would make it
easy to determine to what age any given year belonged, according
to its place at knot first, second, third, or fourth. Thus for
instance, the year <i>tecpatl</i> “flint,” <i>calli</i> “house,” <i>tochtli</i> “rabbit,”
and <i>acatl</i> “reed,” beginning the great cycle, would have one,
five, nine, thirteen dots in the first series; four, eight, twelve, in
the second; three, seven, fourteen, in the third; and two, six, ten,
in the fourth series, which would come first in the new cycle, and
the latter having its appropriate sign would enable one to see at
once that “Flint” 12 was the twelfth year in the second series of
the first cycle or century; that “Flint” 2 was the second year in
the fourth series of the first cycle, etc. Example:</p>

<p>It will be seen later that the hieroglyph <i>calli</i> is the outline of
the Toltec palace and temple, the foundation of his architecture,
which never varies, and which we shall find in all monuments,
whether we travel north or south, on the plateaux or in the lowlands;
so that had everything else been destroyed, we might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">Pg 91</a></span>
nevertheless pronounce with safety that all the monuments in
North America were of Toltec origin. The genius of a nation,
like that of an individual, has generally one dominant note,
traceable through the various expressions of her art. India has
<i>topes</i> and <i>pagodas</i>, Egypt <i>sphinxes</i> and hypostyle chambers, Greece
three orders of columns. North America has only a plain wall
ending with two projecting cornices having an upright or slanting
frieze, more or less ornamented but of no appreciable difference.</p>

every great cycle, will find here a natural place,
and enable us to understand subsequent events.</p>

<p>The Aztecs celebrated their great festival
of the new fire at the end of each century of
fifty-two years, called by Sahagun <i>toxiuilpilli</i>,
and by others <i>xiuhmolpilli</i>. As the end of
the century drew near they were filled with
apprehension, for if the fire failed to be
rekindled, a universal dissolution was expected
to follow. In their despair at such a contingency
they threw away their idols, destroyed their furniture
and domestic utensils, and suffered all fires to go out. A lofty
mountain near Iztapalapan, some two leagues from Mexico,
was the place chosen for kindling the new fire, which was
effected by the friction of two sticks placed on the breast of
the victim. The fire was soon communicated to a funeral pile,
on which the body of the victim was placed and consumed.
This ceremony always took place at midnight, and as the light
mounted up towards heaven shouts of joy burst forth from the
multitudes who covered the hills, the house-tops, and terraces of
the temples, their eyes directed towards the mountain of sacrifice.
Couriers, with torches lighted at the blazing fire, rapidly bore them
to the inhabitants of the surrounding districts, whilst every part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">Pg 92</a></span>
the city was lighted with bonfires. The following days were
given up to festivity, the houses were cleansed and whitewashed,
the broken vessels were replaced by new ones, and the people
dressed in their gayest apparel. If we except human sacrifice, this
must have been a Toltec ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

The modern town occupies but a small proportion of the area of

<p>First in order are three fragments of caryatides: one, a gigantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">Pg 94</a></span>
statue which we reproduce, is about 7 ft. high; the head and
upper part of the body below the hips are wanting, the legs
are 1 ft. 3 in. in diameter, and the feet 4 ft. long. The two
embroidered bits below the waist were no doubt the ends of the
royal <i>maxtli</i>, the exact copy of which we shall see later on
bas-reliefs in Chiapas, Palenque, and Lorillard City. The greaves,
of leather bands, are passed between the toes and fastened on
the instep and above it by large knots, recalling the Roman <i>cacles</i>.
This statue is of black basalt, like all the other fragments; and
although exceedingly rude and archaic in character, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">Pg 95</a></span>
wanting in beauty in some of its details. Next comes a column in
two pieces, lying on the ground, having a round tenon which
fitted closely into the mortise and ensured solidity; it is the only
specimen we have found where such care had been bestowed.
<span class="figright300" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-095b.jpg" width="300" height="290" alt="TENNIS-RING, TULA." />
<span class="caption">TENNIS-RING, TULA.</span></span>
The carving on the
outward portion of
the column consists
of feathers or palms,
whilst the reverse is
covered with scales
of serpents arranged
in parallel sections.
This fragment answers
Sahagun’s description
about the
columns of a temple
dedicated to Quetzalcoatl,
already mentioned,
where rattle-snakes
formed the ornamentation. It is also interesting from
the fact that we shall see a similar column at Chichen-Itza in a
temple of the same god. Here also among other fragments I
noticed a Greek column with a Doric capital, but on which I dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">Pg 96</a></span>
not pronounce definitely, although there is nothing else in the
place denoting Spanish influence. All we can say is that it shows
the marvellous building instinct of the Toltecs, and that we found
some remains of a like description in the Yucatan peninsula. By
far the most interesting object seen here, on account of the study
and the archæological issues it entails, is a large carved stone ring
about 6 ft. 5 in. in diameter, having a hole in the centre some 10 in.
in circumference, evidently a tennis-ring. Tennis, <i>tlacheo</i>, <i>tlachtli</i>,
was first known in Anahuac and transmitted to the Chichemecs,
Acolhuans, and Aztecs by the Toltecs, who carried it with them to
Tabasco, Yucatan, Uxmal, and Chichen; and in the latter place
we found a perfect tennis-court with one ring still in place.</p>

<p>We must turn to Torquemada<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> for full particulars respecting
this national game, which was played in buildings of so typical a
character as to be easily recognised. It consists of two thick
parallel walls 32 ft. high, at a distance of 98 ft. from each other,
having a ring fixed in the walls 22 ft. high, as seen in our cut;
whilst at each extremity of the court stood a small temple in which
preliminary ceremonies were performed before opening the game.
It was played with a large india-rubber ball; the rules required
the player to receive it behind, not to let it touch the ground, and
to wear a tight-fitting leather suit to make the ball rebound. But
the greatest feat was to send the ball through the ring, when a
scramble, a rush, and much confusion followed, the winner having
the right to plunder the spectators of their valuables. Sending
the ball through the ring required so much dexterity, that he who
succeeded was credited with a bad conscience or supposed to be
doomed to an early death. Tennis seems to have been in such
high repute with the Indians that it was not confined to individuals,
but also played between one city and another, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">Pg 97</a></span>accompanied, says Veytia, by much betting, when they staked
everything they possessed, even their liberty. But this writer
errs in ascribing the game to the Aztecs in honour of their god
Huitzilopochtli, as we shall show.</p>

<p>Among other objects which we found at Tula is a large

<span class="caption">WARRIOR’S PROFILE, FOUND AT TULA.</span></span>
curiously-carved shell
of mother-of-pearl;
the carving recalls
Tizoc’s stone, and
notably the bas-reliefs
at Palenque and
Ocosinco in Chiapas;
also two bas-reliefs,
one in a rock outside
the town, the other,
by far the most valuable,
in the wall of
a private house, but
very old and much
injured, representing
a full-face figure and
another in profile;
their nose, beard, and
dress are similar to
those described by
Veytia<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> in the following passage: “The Toltecs were above
middle height, and owing to this they could be distinguished
in later times from the other aborigines. Their
complexion was clear, their hair thicker than the nations who
followed them, although less so than the Spaniards. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">Pg 98</a></span>still observable among the few who remain claiming Toltec
descent.”</p>

<p>These remains are priceless in every respect because of their
analogy and intimate connection with all those we shall subsequently
discover, forming the first links in the chain of evidence
respecting our theory of the unity of American civilisation, which
it is our object to prove in the course of this work.</p>

<p>On beholding these caryatides, the question naturally arises
as to what monument they were intended for; and in turning
to Veytia,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> we read that under the Emperor Mitl (979-1035)
the Toltecs reached the zenith of their power; that their
empire extended over one thousand miles, bordering on the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; and that the population was so
dense as to cause the soil to be cultivated on the highest
mountains, whilst an influential priesthood performed the sacred
rites within innumerable sanctuaries. The great cities of the
high plateaux were Teotihuacan and Cholula, as later Palenque,
Izamal, and Cozumel were those of the warm region. This
emperor, jealous of the flourishing state and religious superiority
of Teotihuacan, “the habitation of the gods,” wished to set
up a new and rival deity for the veneration of his people; to
this end he chose the songstress of the marsh, the “Frog,”
whom he presented as the goddess of waters. And that the
new deity should be ushered in with due pomp and solemnity,
he had a magnificent temple built in her honour, and her gold
statue placed within the temple, covered with emeralds, the size
of a palm, and cunningly worked so as to imitate nature. Up
to that time, temples had been large mounds erected on the
summits of mountains, like that of Tlaloc, or on artificial
pyramids like that of Teotihuacan, where the idols were ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">Pg 99</a></span>posed
to the elements; that of the Frog was the first which
was built with stones and given a <i>rectangular shape</i>, having
a <i>kind of solid vault</i> (boveda), also of stone, <i>which by a skilful
arrangement covered the whole edifice</i>.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Here, then, we have a
very plain description of the Indian vault, the Yucatec vault,
a vault we have observed in the north and the whole extent
of our Toltec journey; seen by Guillemin Tarayre in the tombs
at Las Casas Grandes, mentioned by Ixtlilxochitl as the dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">Pg 100</a></span>tinguishing
feature in the monuments of Toluca and Cuernavaca,
and by Humboldt at Cholula in the following passage: “On
visiting the interior of the pyramid, I recognised a mortuary
chamber, having the bricks of the ceiling so arranged as to
diminish the pression of the roof. As the aborigines were
unacquainted with the vault, they provided for it by placing
horizontally and in gradual succession very large bricks, the
upper slightly overlapping the lower, and in this way replaced
the Gothic vault.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> This remarkable writer further says, that
“Yucatan and Guatemala are countries where the people had

Far greater would have been his appreciation, had his investigations
been directed to the Toltecs and Central America,
where the overlapping vault was introduced by them in all
public edifices, temples, and palaces. With the testimony of
these writers, we may consider the vault question definitely
settled.</p>

<p>The town, or rather the plaza, with its diminutive garden,
planted with a few consumptive shrubs and flowers, with its
porticoes giving access to the Town Hall, the Law Courts,
the Church and shops, only gets animated on Sundays
and market-days, when the population of the surrounding
districts pours in for the purpose of buying or selling. Except
meat, all articles are sold on the ground, spread on plantain
leaves or clean cloths; where vendors dispose themselves in
long rows about the plaza, offering their goods, crockery, and
fruit. Customers stand about in groups, surveying the animated
scene, enjoying a little gossip, or trying to drive a hard bargain;
whilst Indian matrons ply from one vendor to another in almost
silent dignity, accompanied by their daughters, who look at this

to exchange a few words with the merchant or an acquaintance.
Some look quite pretty, with their glorious eyes, their
long hair reaching below the waist in two long plaits, with
glass or stone beads around their necks; their scanty costume
leaving uncovered their shapely arms, necks, and ankles. On
looking at them, I seem to myself to be carried back a
thousand years amidst that grand old race whose ruins I am
here to study. Further on, under a monumental ash-tree,
primitive kitchens have been set up, round which a dense
throng of customers, settled on the ground, are enjoying their
<i>tortillas</i>, or when they are well-to-do, their portion of black
beans, <i>frijoles</i>, pork or turkey, in <i>jicaras</i>, the whole highly
seasoned with Chili pepper; the best dinner not costing more
than threepence.</p>

<p>Every human type seems to have congregated here, from
the Egyptian sharp outline of features to the flat-nosed, flat-faced
Kalmuk. Most women are bare to the waist; but as
this seems a matter of course, no one notices it.</p>

<p>The area of ancient Tula has now been under cultivation
for three hundred years—hardly a desirable condition for the
explorer. We know that the city stood here; but its only
vestiges are to be found on the hill overlooking the town to
the north. It was called <i>Palpan</i> in the time of the Toltecs;
but now it is known as <i>Cerro del Tesoro</i>, because a poor
shepherd-boy, some twenty years since, whilst scratching the
moist ground, discovered a vase with five hundred gold ounces
in it; but not knowing the value of his newly-found treasure,
he parted with it for a few coppers. We are going to try
our luck on the same hill; and better advised than the poor
shepherd, we shall not give up our discoveries in favour of
any one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> plateau on the Palpan hill, of which we give a ground plan,
was occupied by a royal park, and maybe those of a few notables.
Its direction is south-west, north-west, about a mile in length and
half-a-mile in breadth, growing to a point towards the south-west,
and fenced on two sides by a natural wall of perpendicular rocks
overhanging the river. The plateau is covered with mounds,
pyramids, and esplanades, showing that here were the royal
villas, temples, and public edifices, but no trace of building, wall,
or ruin, is visible, for the whole area is shrouded with immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">Pg 105</a></span>
cactuses, nopals, gorambullos, gum-trees, and mesquites, amongst
which towers the <i>biznaga</i>, a cactus which grows here to nearly
10 ft. high by 6 ft. wide. I was shown a plant of this kind near
Pachuca, in which an Indian couple have established themselves.</p>

<p>The summits of pyramids, called <i>mogotes</i> by the natives, were
always occupied by temples and palaces; the largest here, No. 4

and No. 5 in our cut,
must have served as
basements for the
temples of the Sun
and Moon. Unfortunately
they have
been opened and ransacked
by treasure-seekers,
and half-demolished
by brick-layers,
who found
here materials ready
to hand for their
constructions.</p>

<p>I began my excavations
by sounding
the small mound
No. 1 to the northeast,
where the side
of a wall was visible; and I found everywhere the ground connecting
houses, palaces, and gardens, thickly coated with cement:
but in the inner rooms the flooring was of red cement. The
rubbish was cleared away, and in a few days a complete house
was unearthed, consisting of several apartments of various size,
nearly all on different levels; having frescoed walls, columns,
pilasters, benches, and cisterns, recalling a Roman <i>impluvium</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">Pg 106</a></span>
whilst flights of steps and narrow passages connected the various
apartments. We had brought to light a Toltec house!</p>

<p>I picked out of the rubbish many curious things: huge baked
bricks, from one foot to nine inches by two and two and a half
in thickness; filters, straight and curved water-pipes, vases and
fragments of vases, enamelled terra-cotta cups, bringing to mind
those at Tenenepanco; seals, one of which (an eagle’s head) I had
engraved for my personal use; bits which were curiously like old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">Pg 107</a></span>
Japanese china; moulds, one having a head with a huge plait and
hair smoothed on both sides of her face, like an old maid;
besides innumerable arrow-heads and knives of obsidian strewing
the ground. In fact, a whole civilisation.</p>

<p>This house, the first it was our fortune to discover, was built
on a somewhat modified natural elevation; the various apartments

follow the
direction of the
ground and are
ranged on different
levels, numbering
from zero
elevation for the
lowest to 8 ft.
for the highest.
The walls are
perpendicular, the
roofs flat; and a
thick coating of
cement, the same
everywhere, was
used, whether for
roofs, ceilings,
floors, pavements,
or roads.</p>

<p>On examining
the monuments at Tula, we are filled with admiration for the
marvellous building capacity of the people who erected them;
for, unlike most primitive nations, they used every material at
once. They coated their inner walls with mud and mortar,
faced their outer walls with baked bricks and cut stone, had
wooden roofs, and brick and stone staircases. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">Pg 108</a></span>
acquainted with pilasters (we found them in their houses), with
caryatides, with square and round columns; indeed, they seem to
have been familiar with every architectural device. That they
were painters and decorators we have ample indications in the
house we unearthed, where the walls are covered with rosettes,
palms, red, white, and gray geometrical figures on a black ground.</p>

<p>My next soundings were towards the centre of the hill, at
a mound marked No. 2, which I took at first for a tomb; but
finding nothing, I directed my men south-east, at the extremity
of the hill, No. 3. Here we attacked a pyramid of considerable
size, thickly covered with vegetation, having a hole and a thick
plaster coating, which, to my extreme delight, revealed an old
palace, extending over an area of nearly 62 ft. on one side, with
an inner courtyard, a garden, and numerous apartments on
different levels, ranged from the ground-floor to 8 ft. high, exactly
like the first house; the whole covering a surface of 2,500 square
yards. We will give a description of it, together with the
probable use of the various apartments. No. 1 (see plan) is the
inner courtyard, which we take as our level; No. 3 to the right,
paved with large pebbles, is the main entrance. Facing this to
the left, No. 7 is a small room about 4 ft. high, which was entered
by a flight of seven low steps; it is a Belvedere, from which a
view of the whole valley could be obtained. Next comes No. 4,
perhaps a reception-room, 32 ft. long, having two openings towards
the court. On the other side, to the north, is a smaller, narrower
Belvedere, from which an ante-room, on a slightly lower level,
furnished with benches, was reached. The main body of the
palace consists of ten apartments of different size, with stuccoed
walls and floors. The façade, No. 2, 8 ft. high, opens on the
courtyard; whilst two winding stone staircases to the right,
and an equal number to the left, led to the apartments on the
first storey. Brick steps, covered with a deep layer of cement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">Pg 109</a></span>
connected the various chambers. The cells on both sides of
the main apartments may have been the servants’ quarters.
No. 6, are a kind of yards, without any trace of roof, and
if we are to judge from Aztec dwellings, they were probably
enclosures for domestic and wild animals. The Americans, says
Clavigero,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> had no flocks; nevertheless their table was well
supplied by innumerable animals to be found about their dwellings,
and unknown to Europe; whilst the poor people had an
edible dog, <i>techichi</i>, the breed of which was lost by the abuse
the Spaniards made of it in the early times of the Conquest.
Royal palaces had extensive spaces reserved for turkeys, ducks,
and every species of volatile, a menagerie for wild animals,
chambers for reptiles and birds of prey, and tanks for fish; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">Pg 110</a></span>that the purpose we ascribe to these enclosures becomes highly
probable. Here and there closed-up passages, walls rebuilt
with materials other than those employed in the older construction,
seem to indicate that the palace was occupied at two
different periods; this would agree with Veytia<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> when he says,
“that on the Chichemecs invading the country under the
command of <i>Xolotl</i>, they found Tula (<i>cir.</i> 1117) deserted, and
grass growing in the streets; but that the King was so pleased
with the site that he ordered the monuments to be repaired
and the town inhabited. He followed the same policy at
Teotihuacan and other places, ordering his people to preserve
old names, and only authorising them to give new appellations
to those they should build themselves.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p class="caption">VIEW OF RUINED TOLTEC PALACE.</p></div>

<p>The building we unearthed is entire, its outer wall intact;
presenting a valuable specimen of the houses dating long before
the Conquest. Here we found the same kind of objects as
in our first excavations: plates, dishes, three-footed cups having
striated bottoms and used for grinding Chili pepper; fragments
of pottery, enamels, terra-cotta whorls of different size covered
with sunk designs having a hole in the centre. These whorls
are called “<i>malacates</i>” by the natives, and used by Indian
women to this day. A round piece of wood or spindle-stick is
introduced in the hole of the whorl, projecting about five inches
from the lower plane, and about nine inches from the upper.
The spinner, who is sitting, rests the point of her spindle on
a varnished plate, and impels it round with her thumb and
forefinger, twisting the cotton or wool attached thereto.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> In
Mexico, rich ladies used a golden plate.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">Pg 111</a></span></p>

<p>The edifice No. 7 is undoubtedly a tennis-court, for it
answers exactly the description given by historians of such
structures; moreover, I found one of the rings still in place.
Veytia is wrong, therefore, in crediting the Mexicans with the
invention of the game; were it so we should not have found a
tennis-court at Chichen-Itza. Mendieta<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> relates how Tezacatlipoca
came down from his celestial abode on a spider’s ladder, and
how in his long peregrinations on earth he visited Tula, brought
thither by his jealousy of Quetzalcoatl, whom he challenged to
play tennis; but the latter turning into a tiger discomfited him
utterly. The spectators were so terrified that they fled, and
in the tumult which ensued many were drowned <i>in the river
flowing close by</i>.</p>

<p>This tradition shows plainly that tennis existed in the remote
period of Quetzalcoatl’s rule at Tula; that the game was of
Toltec origin, that the court was on the hill, since the spectators
in their precipitancy to run away were drowned, that Quetzalcoatl
was a good tennis-player, and that the expression, “he was
turned into a tiger,” is merely honorific, applied to him on
the spot for having sent his ball through the ring. This passage
also explains the tiger frieze over the tennis-court at Chichen-Itza.</p>

<p>The Toltecs had public granaries which were opened to
the people in time of famine. A passage in Cuauhtitlan seems
to indicate that the resistance they opposed to a grasping
and bloodthirsty priesthood, was one of the chief causes of
their downfall.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> “Under the mild rule of Quetzalcoatl, demons
tried in vain to persuade him to allow <i>men born at Tula to be
sacrificed</i>. As for himself, his offerings were birds, serpents, and
butterflies he had captured in the valley.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">Pg 112</a></span></p>

<p>The Toltecs were peaceful, their organisation was feudal and
aristocratic, indicative of conquest, yet their government was
paternal. Besides the great feudatory lords, they had military
orders and titles, which were bestowed on distinguished soldiers
for services in the field or the council, and finally the celebrated
order of the <i>Tecuhtlis</i>, which was divided in sub-orders of the
“tiger,” the “lion,” the “eagle,” and other animals, each having
its peculiar privileges. The initiatory ceremonies resembled
somewhat those attending our knights of the Middle Ages, and
may interest the reader.</p>

<p>At the nomination of a candidate, all the tecuhtlis assembled
in the house of the new knight, whence they set
out in a body for the temple, where the high priest, at
the request of the neophyte, perforated his nose and ears
with a pointed tiger’s bone, or an eagle’s claw, inserting
in the holes thus made twigs, which were changed every
day for larger ones, until the healing of the wound; pronouncing
the while invocations to the gods that they would
give the novice the courage of the lion, the swiftness of the
deer, etc.; followed by a speech in which he was reminded
that he who aspires to the dignity of a tecuhtli, must be
ready to perform the duties of his new office. He was
henceforth to be distinguished by greater meekness, patience,
forbearance, and moderation in all things, together with submission
to the laws. After this speech, he was deprived of
his rich garments, and dressed in a coarse tunic; the only
articles of furniture allowed him were a common mat and a
low stool. He was besmeared with a black preparation, and
only broke his fast once in twenty-four hours with a tortilla
and a small quantity of water. Meanwhile the priests and
tecuhtlis came in turns to feast before the novice, and make
his fast more intolerable, heaping insults and injurious epithets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">Pg 113</a></span>
upon the man who stood meekly before them; jostling and
pointing their fingers jeeringly at him. At night he was only
allowed to sleep a few minutes at a time; and if overcome
by sleep, his guardians pricked him with the thorn of the
maguey.</p>

<p>“At the expiration of sixty days the new knight, accompanied
by friends and relatives, repaired to some temple of his own
district, where he was received by the whole order of tecuhtlis,
ranged in two rows on each side of the temple, from the main altar
down to the entrance. He advanced alone, bowing right and left to
each tecuhtli, until he reached the idol, where the mean garments
he had worn so long were taken off by the oldest tecuhtli, his hair
bound up in a knot on the top of his head with a red string;
whilst a wreath, having a medallion with his motto graven on it,
circled his brow. He was next clad in rich and fine apparel, ornamented
and delicately embroidered; in his hands he received
arrows and a bow; balls of gold were inserted in his ears and
nostrils, and a precious stone, the distinctive badge of his order,
hung from his lower lip. The ceremony ended with another
discourse to the effect that the neophyte should aim at being
liberal, just, free from arrogance, and willing to devote his life to
the service of his country and his gods.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>The Toltecs paid great attention to the instruction of youth.
Texcuco possessed schools of art, in which the broad principles
laid down by their forefathers were doubtless remembered, differing
from those of the Aztecs, whose exaggerated religiosity caused
them to leave the education of children entirely in the hands
of the priests. That the latter were less influential with the
Toltecs seems indicated in the following passage: “Among the
various sumptuous edifices at Utatlan was the college, having a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">Pg 114</a></span>staff of seventy teachers, and five or six thousand pupils, who were
educated at the public expense.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> The truth of this account is
borne out by the fact that the city was only destroyed in 1524 by
Alvarado, so that the early missionaries had ample opportunity
given them to collect materials for a trustworthy history.</p>

<p>Marriage among the Toltecs was celebrated with ceremonies it
may interest the reader to know something about. On this
occasion friends and relations were invited, the walls of the best
apartment were adorned with pretty devices, made with flowers
and evergreens, whilst every table and bracket was covered with
them. The bridegroom occupied a seat to the right, the bride sat
on the floor to the left of the hearth, which stood in the middle of
the room, where a bright fire was burning. Then the “marriage-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">Pg 115</a></span>maker,”
as he was called, stood up and addressed the young
people, reminding them of their mutual duties in the life they were
about to enter, and, at the termination of his speech, they were
given new cloaks, and received the good wishes and congratulations
of their friends, who as they came up threw each in turn
some perfume on the hearth. Now the bride and bridegroom
were crowned with chaplets of flowers, and the day was wound up
with dance, music, and refreshments. There was also a religious
ceremony similar to this in all respects, in which a priest
officiated; when instead of cloaks they put on costly dresses
with a skeleton head embroidered on them, and thus attired,
the new married couple were accompanied to their home and
left to themselves.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>In order to have a complete idea of this extraordinary people,
a few words upon their philosophy and ethics may find an appropriate
place here. A Toltec maiden, about to enter into life, was
admonished with great tenderness by her father to preserve
simplicity in her manners and conversation, to have great neatness
in attire and attention to personal cleanliness. He inculcated
modesty, faithfulness, and obedience to her husband, reminding
her that this world is a place of sorrow and disappointment, but
that God had given as a compensation domestic joys and material
enjoyments; softening his advice by such endearing words as:
“daughter mine, my beloved daughter, my precious,” etc. Nor was
the advice of a mother less touching—breathing throughout a
parent’s love: “My beloved daughter, my little dove, you have heard
the words which your father has told you. They are precious
words, such as are rarely spoken, and which have proceeded from
his heart. Speak calmly and deliberately; do not raise your voice
very high, nor speak very low, but in a moderate tone. Neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">Pg 116</a></span>mince, when you speak, nor when you salute, nor speak through
your nose; but let your words be proper, and your voice gentle.
In walking, see that you behave becomingly, neither going with
haste, nor too slowly; yet, when it is necessary to go with haste,
do so. When you are obliged to jump over a pool of water, do it
with decency. Walk through the streets quietly; do not look
hither and thither, nor turn your head to look at this and that;
walk neither looking at the skies nor at the ground. See likewise
that you neither paint your face nor your lips, in order to look
well, since this is a mark of vile and immodest women. But that
your husband may take pleasure in you, adorn yourself, wash
yourself, and wear nothing but clean clothes, but let this be done
with moderation, since if you are over nice—too delicate—they
will call you <i>tapetzeton, tinemaxoch</i>. This was the course and
the manner of your ancestors. In this world it is necessary to live
with prudence and circumspection. See that you guard yourself
carefully and free from stain, for should you give your favour to
another who is not your husband, you would be ruined past all
recall; since for such a crime they will kill you, throw you into the
street for an example to all the people, where your head will be
crushed and dragged upon the ground,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>We will end these quotations by the advice to a son: “My
beloved son, lay to heart the words I am going to utter, for
they are from our forefathers, who admonished us to keep them
locked up like precious gold-leaf, and taught us that boys and
girls are beloved of the Lord. For this reason the men of old,
who were devoted to His service, held children in great reverence.
They roused them out of their sleep, undressed them, bathed
them in cold water, made them sweep the temples and offer
copal to the gods. They washed their mouths, saying that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">Pg 117</a><br /><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">Pg 118</a><br /><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">Pg 119</a></span>God heard their prayers and accepted their exercises, their tears,
and their sorrow, because they were of a pure heart, perfect,
and without blemish, like <i>chalchihuitl</i> (precious stones). They
added that this world was preserved for their sake, and that
they were our intercessors before Him. Satraps, wise men, and
those killed by lightning were supposed to be particularly
agreeable to the Sun, who called them to himself that they
might live for ever in his presence in a perpetual round of
delight,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p class="caption">YOUNG TOLTEC GIRL, FROM MODERN INDIAN TYPES AND FATHER DURAN’S “HIST. DE LAS INDIAS.”</p></div>

<p>And what can be more beautiful than the prayer addressed
to Tlaloc: “O Lord, liberal giver of all things, Lord of freshness
and verdure, Lord of sweet-smelling paradise, Lord of incense
and copal. Alas! your vassals, the gods of water, have disappeared,
and lie concealed in their deep caverns, having stowed
away all things indispensable to life, although they continue to
receive the <i>ulli yauhtli</i> and copal offering. They have also
carried away their sister, the goddess of substance. O Lord,
have pity on us that live. Our food goes to destruction, is
lost and dried up for lack of water; it is as if turned to dust and
mixed with spiders’ webs. Wilt thou have no pity on the
<i>macehuetes</i> and the common people, who are wasted with
hunger, and go about unrecognisable and disfigured? They
are blue under the eyes as with death; their mouths are dry
as sedge; all the bones of their bodies show as in a skeleton.
The children are disfigured and yellow as earth; not only those
that begin to walk, but even those in the cradle. This torment
of hunger comes to every one; the very animals and birds
suffer from dire want. It is pitiful to see the birds, some
dragging themselves along with drooping wings, others falling
down unable to walk, and others with their mouth still open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">Pg 120</a></span>through hunger and thirst. O Lord, Thou wert wont to give
us abundantly of those things which are the life and joy of
all the world, and precious as emeralds and sapphires; all these
things have departed from us. O Lord God of nourishment,
most kind and compassionate, what hast Thou determined to
do with us? Hast Thou utterly forsaken us? Shall not Thy
wrath and indignation be appeased? Wilt Thou destroy these
Thy servants, and leave this city and kingdom desolate and
uninhabited? Is it so decreed in heaven and hades? O
Lord, grant, at least, that these innocent children, who cannot
so much as walk, and those still in the cradle, may have
something to eat, so that they may live and die not in this
terrible famine. What have they done that they should be so
tried, and should die of hunger? They have committed no
iniquity, neither do they know what thing it is to sin; they
neither offended the gods of heaven nor the gods of hell. We,
if we have offended in many things, if our sins have reached
heaven and hades and the uttermost parts of the world,
it is but just that we should be destroyed. O Lord, invigorate
the corn and other substances, much wished for
and much needed, now sown and planted; for the ridges
of the earth suffer sore need and anguish from lack of water.
Grant, O Lord, that the people receive this favour and mercy
at Thine hand; let them see and enjoy the verdure and coolness
which are as precious stones. See good that the fruit and
the substance of the Tlalocs be given, which are the clouds
that these gods carry with them and that give us rain. May
it please Thee, O Lord, that the animals and herbs be made
glad, and that the fowls and birds of precious feather, such
as the <i>quechotl</i> and the <i>çaquan</i>, fly and sing and feast upon
the herbs and flowers. And let not this come about with
thunder and lightning, symbols of Thy wrath; for if our lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">Pg 121</a></span>
the Tlalocs come in this way, the people, being lean and very
weak with hunger, would be terrified.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>The degree of culture of a nation can be gauged from its
religion, and notably its ideas of a future life. The beauty
and eloquence-loving Greek discoursed upon philosophy walking
under noble porticoes; the thoughts of the barbarous worshipper
of Woden were of bloody fights, and of wassail in which he
drank hydromel out of his enemies’ skulls; the Arab goes to
sleep cradled on the lap of houris; the Red Indian dreams of
endless hunting-fields, whilst the starving Bushman hopes for
a heaven of plenty. The Toltec is the only one whose aspirations
beyond the grave are free from grossness and cruelty;
his heaven is a resting-place for the weary, a perpetual spring,
amidst flowers, fields of yellow maize, verdure and flowers.</p>

<p>From these graver matters we will pass to the legend,
told by Veytia, which makes Papantzin the inventor of pulque;
and although, in our opinion, he places this event too late, it
is none the less instructive as showing another side of Toltec
history. In the year 1049, or, according to Clavigero, 1024-1030,
Tecpancaltzin was one day taking his <i>siesta</i> in the palace, when
Papantzin, one of his great nobles, presented himself together
with his daughter, the beautiful <i>Xochitl</i> (“flower”), bearing, with
other gifts to the king, a kind of liqueur, made from the maguey
juice by a process of which Papantzin was the inventor. The
new drink pleased the royal palate, and the lovely form and
face of the young maiden were still more pleasing to the royal
taste. The king expressed his desire to have more of the
new beverage at the hands of the fair Xochitl, adding that
she might bring it unattended save by her nurse. Proud of
the honour shown him, Papantzin a few days later sent Xochitl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">Pg 122</a></span>accompanied by a dueña, with some pulque. Xochitl was
introduced alone to the presence of Tecpancaltzin. Bravely
the maiden resisted the monarch’s protestations of ardent love,
but alone and unprotected she was unable to resist the threats
and violence used against her. She was then sent to the
strongly-guarded palace of Palpan near the capital;” and there,
cut off from all communication with parents or friends, she
lived as the king’s mistress. Her father meanwhile was told
that his daughter had been entrusted by the king to the care
of some matrons, who would perfect her education and fit her
for a high position among the court ladies. Meanwhile the
king visited Xochitl, and in 1051 a child was born, who received
the name of <i>Meconetzin</i> (“child of the maguey”), and later
that of <i>Topiltzin</i> (the “Justicer”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>), by which he is known in
history. But at last Papantzin, suspecting that all was not
right with his daughter, visited the palace of Palpan in the
disguise of a labourer; he found her and listened to the tale
of her shame. His wrath knew no bounds, but he was quieted
with the king’s promise that the child should be proclaimed
heir to the throne, and that, should the queen die, Xochitl
would succeed her as his legitimate consort. It should be
mentioned that polygamy and concubinage were strictly
forbidden among the Toltecs of that period; that the laws
were binding on king and peasant alike; and this explains
why Tecpancaltzin was obliged to keep his love for Xochitl
secret, until he was free to proclaim her publicly his queen;
a step which was fraught with endless evils for his country,
since after his death the Toltec princes, who were thus
deprived of their hope of succession, broke out into open
hostilities. The most powerful of these and nearest to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">Pg 123</a><br /><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">Pg 124</a><br /><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">Pg 125</a></span>the throne was Huehuetzin;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> with him were banded the
caciques of the northern provinces beyond Jalisco and those
bordering on the Atlantic Ocean, when after years of warfare,
followed by calamitous inundations, tempests, droughts, famine,
and pestilence (1097), the Toltecs, greatly reduced in numbers,
dispersed; some directing their march south (the Toluca and
Cuernavaca branch), others going north (the Tula and Teotihuacan
branch) founded establishments at Tehuantepec, Guatemala,
Goatzacoalco, Tabasco, and Campeche; whilst a few
remained at Cholula and Chapultepec.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Ixtlilxochitl<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> places this
event in 1008. Sixteen hundred are said to have settled at
Colhuacan, intermarried with Chichemec caciques, and founded
the family from which the kings of Texcuco were descended.
Clavigero writes that the miserable remains of the nation found
a remedy in flight (1031-1050), some settling in Yucatan and
Guatemala, whilst others, with the two sons of Topiltzin, remained
in the Tula valley, and that their grandsons were
subsequently closely connected with the royal families of Mexico,
Texcuco, and Colhuacan.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Finally Torquemada<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> writes “that
they were counselled by the devil to abandon their country to
escape utter annihilation, and that the account of their migrations
is to be found in Acolhuan histories, written in peculiar characters
as is the custom of these aborigines.”</p>

<p>The Toltec soldiers wore a quilted cotton tunic that fitted closely
to the body and protected also the shoulders and thighs; their offensive
weapons consisted of spears, light javelins, and clubs studded
with steel, silver, or gold nails. They used a copper currency,
which a short while ago was still found among the Tutupecans.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">Pg 126</a></span></p>

<p>These quotations, which might be multiplied, clearly prove
that the Toltecs migrated south, following the coasts of both
oceans; that they ceased to exist as a nation after the disruption
of their empire; but that their scattered remnants carried
on the work of civilisation in Central America, on the high
plateaux, and in Anahuac; evidenced in the strong resemblance
that the civilisations of these various regions bear to one
another.</p>

<p>We will close this chapter with a few words about the
Chichemecs, who occupied the valley after the Toltecs. Their
emperor Xolotl made Tenayuca, to the west of Lake Texcuco,
his capital, and despatched four chiefs, with a strong escort, to
explore the country in every direction. They were absent four
years, and in their report (1124) they stated that they had met
with some Toltecs in the region formerly held by them; but that
the greater proportion had founded important colonies in the
far-off provinces of Tehuantepec, Guatemala, Tecocotlan, and
Tabasco. Nopaltzin, the son of this emperor, sent likewise
emissaries from Teotihuacan, whose report was to the effect that
they had found a few Toltecs scattered in five different places,
who told them of their hardships, adding that most of their fellow-citizens
had gone farther west and south.</p>

<p>From these quotations it is clearly seen that the date of the
oldest edifices in Tabasco cannot be anterior to the beginning
of the twelfth century;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> that Toltec influence was felt simultaneously
on the high plateaux and in Central America, shown
by the flourishing small Toltec state of Colhuacan, where King
Architometl (1231) had revived those arts and sciences his
ancestors had initiated, and which, since their extermination,
had fallen into utter decay. This king succeeded so well in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">Pg 127</a></span>his enlightened policy that his country became an intelligent
centre, which proved so beneficial to the barbarous Chichemecs.</p>

<p>Nopaltzin, following the example of Xolotl, compelled those
of his subjects who still lived in caverns to build houses, live
in communities, cultivate the land, and feed on prepared viands.
He invited jewellers and lapidaries from Colhuacan to teach
his people, instituting prizes for those who became proficient
in mechanical arts, and also for those who made astrology, historical
paintings, and the deciphering of ancient manuscripts their
particular study.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> And, lastly, in the closing words of Veytia’s
account, he says: “Among the documents I possess for the
completion of my work are several bearing on the Mexicans.
I found no difficulty in reading the paintings and maps; but
although they are systematically classified as regards events
posterior to their arrival in the valley, it is very different with
their antiquities, their origin, and their wanderings; <i>their
documents relating to this period being more rare and obscure
than those of the Toltecs</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>Having proved, and we think we have proved, the diffusion
of Toltec arts and industries among the primitive populations of
America, we will proceed to Teotihuacan.</p>

Aspect of the Pyramids—Cement Coatings—<i>Tlateles</i> and
Pyramids—Idols and Masks—Description by Torquemada—S. Martin’s
Village—Pulque and Mezcal—S. Juan of Teotihuacan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> account of its vicinity to Mexico, Teotihuacan has been so
often described, that there is little or nothing to be said which
has not been well said before. She was a flourishing city at
the time of the Toltecs, and the rival of Tula; and like her
was destroyed and subsequently rebuilt by the Chichemec
emperor Xolotl, preserving under the new <i>régime</i> her former
supremacy. In the opinion of Veytia, Torquemada, and other
historians, Teotihuacan was a Toltec city; and my excavations
in bringing to light palaces having nearly the same arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">Pg 129</a></span>
as those at Tula, will confirm their opinion. The orientation
of this city is indicated by Clavigero in the following
passage:</p>

<p>“The famous edifices at Teotihuacan, three miles north of
this village and twenty-five from Mexico, are still in existence.”</p>

<p>The two principal pyramids were dedicated to the Sun and
Moon, and were taken as models for building later temples in
this region. That of the Sun is the most considerable, measuring
680 feet at the base by 180 feet high. Like all great
pyramids, they were divided into four storeys, three of which
are still visible, but the intermediate gradations are almost
effaced. A temple stood on the summit of the larger mound,
having a colossal statue of the Sun, made of one single block
of stone.</p>

<p>Its breast had a hollow, in which was placed a planet of
fine gold. This statue was destroyed by Zumarraga, first Bishop
of Mexico, and the gold seized by the insatiable Spaniards. The
interior of the pyramid is composed of clay and volcanic pebbles,
incrusted on the surface with the light porous stone, <i>tetzontli</i>;
over this was a thick coating of white stucco, such as was used
for dwellings. Where the pyramid is much defaced, its incline
is from thirty-one to thirty-six degrees, and where the coatings
of cement still adhere, forty-seven degrees. The ascent was
arduous, especially with a burning sun beating down upon us;
but when we reached the top, we were amply repaid by the
glorious view which unfolded before our enraptured gaze. To
the north the Pyramid of the Moon, and the great “Path of
Death” (<i>Micoatl</i>), with its tombs and tumuli, covering a space
of nine square miles; to the south and south-west the hills of
Tlascala, the villages of S. Martin and S. Juan, the snowy
top of Iztaccihuatl towering above the <i>Matlacinga</i> range; and
in the west the Valley of Mexico with its lakes, whilst far, far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">Pg 130</a></span>
away the faint outline of the Cordilleras was perceptible in this
clear atmosphere.</p>

<p>If by an effort of the imagination we were to try and reconstruct
this dead city, restore her dwellings, her temples and
pyramids, coated with pink and white outer coatings, surrounded
by verdant gardens, intersected by beautiful roads paved with
red cement, the whole bathed in a flood of sunshine, we should
realise the vivid description given by Torquemada: “All the
temples and palaces were perfectly built, whitewashed and polished
outside; so that it gave one a real pleasure to view them from
a little distance. All the streets and squares were beautifully
paved, and they looked so daintily clean as to make you almost
doubt their being the work of human hands, destined for human
feet; nor am I drawing an imaginary picture, for besides what
I have been told, I myself have seen ruins of temples, with
noble trees and beautiful gardens full of fragrant flowers, which
were grown for the service of the temples.” This quotation
goes far to prove that the ruins are not so ancient as some
writers have maintained; but that temples and palaces were
extant at the time of the Conquest, and that pyramids were
repaired by the successive occupants of the soil, even during
the wars which a displacement of races naturally entailed.</p>

<p>The outline of the pyramids is everywhere visible, and
serves as a beacon to guide the traveller to the ruins of
Teotihuacan, about thirty-seven miles north of Mexico. Besides
these, there are some smaller mounds to the south, indicating
that the ancient city extended as far as Matlacinga hill, which
bounds the valley on this side, whilst it stretched six miles to
the north.</p>

<p>We set out under the escort of an Indian, and soon
reach an immense mound known as the <i>Citadel</i>, measuring over
1,950 feet at the sides. It is a quadrangular enclosure, consist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">Pg 131</a></span>ing
of four embankments some 19 feet high and 260 feet thick,
on which are ranged fifteen pyramids; whilst, towards the centre,
a narrower embankment is occupied by a higher pyramid, which
connects the north and south walls. The shape of the citadel
bears a strong resemblance to a vast tennis-court, and if not
the latter, it was in all probability used for public ceremonies,
but never as a citadel. A little further we crossed a dry watercourse,
which becomes a torrent in the rainy season. The bed
is full of obsidian pebbles, some transparent, some opaque green,
but most of a grayish tint. On the opposite bank of the torrent
we observed in some places three layers of cement, laid down
in the same way, and consisting of the same materials, as I
can certify, notwithstanding all that has been said to the
contrary.</p>

<p>This cement is identical with that of Tula, except that there
it was probably done for the sake of solidity, since it is only
to be met with on the declivity of the hill; whereas here, where
the city was demolished several times, it was due to the fact
that the new occupant did not care to clear the ground of all
the rubbish, but contented himself with smoothing down the
old coating and laying a new one on the top of it. This supposition
becomes almost a certainty when we add that numerous
fragments of pottery have been found between the layers. This
is, besides, amply exemplified in Rome and other cities, where
ancient monuments are divided from later ones by thick layers
of detritus; nor is it necessary for a long interval to have
occurred between the two. On the other hand, if we suppose
the soil between the coatings to have accumulated there by the
work of time, an antiquity must be ascribed to these first constructions
which would simply be ridiculous; and we think
that if Mendoza had visited the ground, his conclusions would
have been much modified. Traces of edifices and walls occupy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">Pg 132</a></span>
the base of the torrent, showing that the bed was narrower
formerly than it is now, and that it was presumably embanked
and spanned by several bridges. As we advance towards the
Pyramid of the Sun, fragments of all kinds meet our eyes in
every direction; the fields are strewn with pottery, masks, small
figures, Lares, ex-votos, small idols, broken cups, stone axes,
etc. I select for myself some masks which portray the various
Indian types with marvellous truth, and at times not without
some artistic skill. Among them are types which do not seem
to belong to America: a negro (see <a href="#plate">plate</a>), whose thick lips,
flat nose, and woollen hair proclaim his African origin; below
this a Chinese head, Caucasian and Japanese specimens; heads
with retreating foreheads, like those displayed at Palenque, and
not a few with Greek profiles. The lower jaw is straight or
projecting, the faces smooth or bearded; in short, it is a
wonderful medley, indicative of the numerous races who succeeded
each other, and amalgamated on this continent, which,
until lately, was supposed to be so new, and is in truth so old.</p>

<p>Some writers, on viewing the configuration of these massive
mounds, have erroneously concluded that they were built for
the same purpose as the Egyptian pyramids; but we cannot
sufficiently impress on the reader that in America the pyramid
was synonymous with temple, or used as basement for temples
and palaces. People may have been buried in the former, as
they were buried in the latter; but that is no evidence of any
analogy subsisting between them. In Egypt the pyramid was
a sepulchre and nothing more, which received additions each
successive year, and assumed smaller or greater dimensions,
according to the longevity of the sovereign who erected it.
The gigantic pyramids of Cheops, Chephren, and Mycerinus,
correspond to reigns of sixty years each; the smaller correspond
to short reigns in which kings were not given time for con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">Pg 133</a></span>structing
great monuments. Now, the American mounds belong
to one epoch, were built on one plan without any intermission.
Architecture, whether civil or religious, entirely differs in the
two countries. In Egypt palaces were built of wood; in
America they were built of stone. Among Egyptians temples
were colossal; among Americans, on the contrary, they were
small, primitive, hardly more than altars. The temple was all-important
with the former, the palace with the latter. In fact,
the two polities were diametrically opposed, save on such points
of contact as are common to all races in the early stage of their
civilisation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">Pg 134</a></span></p>

<p>Some writers, arguing from the existence of a civilisation
anterior to the Incas, concluded, with some show of reason,
that there existed a pre-Toltec civilisation also; but a moment’s
reflection will show that no parallel exists between the two;
for the former, in a climate eminently favourable to the preservation
of monuments, has hardly left any trace, whilst the
latter, in a climate peculiarly destructive, has left whole cities
and monuments in almost perfect preservation. In Peru, the
people who followed the earlier races used extant remains for
the foundations of their monuments, as, for instance, at Cuzco;
whereas in Mexico and Central America monuments were repaired
and restored on the same plan as that on which they
had been erected. It follows that in Peru edifices are totally
different in character from the foundations and cyclopean walls
which support them, unless the ruins of Las Casas Grandes be
considered pre-Toltec; but even so they would be the remains
of edifices constructed by the first Nahua tribes in their progress
towards the south.</p>

<p>Our digression has sharpened our appetites, and we hasten
to the “fonda” by a short cut across imposing structures and
the remains of houses built by the Spaniards who first settled
here after the Conquest. Although they tried to build on the
same principles as the Indians, they succeeded indifferently, for
their constructions are but a ruinous mass, in the courtyards
and open walls of which the poor Indians have established their
cabins. These cabins measure barely six feet square; yet
within them whole families lie huddled up together on the
beaten ground, nearly suffocated in summer, almost frozen in
winter, nursing their misery. A few beans, a tortilla, is all
the food they have, and often not even that. Their children
are numerous, but more than half die in the first years for
want of proper care. The men earn one shilling a day—one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">Pg 135</a></span>
shilling to feed, clothe, and house eight or nine people. What
wonder if they are in tatters which leave them half uncovered,
exposed to the mercy of the elements? Outside these huts—for
the inside does not own so much as a wooden peg—stands
the <i>metate</i>, before which women are kneeling nearly the whole
day grinding Indian corn for tortillas.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you put a roof over these standing walls?
You would get, at very small cost, a comfortable dwelling
for your families.”</p>

<p>“But, señor, we have no wood.”</p>

<p>“What, with all those trees about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">Pg 136</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, señor, we should have to pay for them, and where
is the money to come from?”</p>

<p>“Why, then, club together, three or four families of
you. These huge houses are quite spacious enough for the
purpose.”</p>

<p>They only shook their heads incredulously; so simple
a notion was quite beyond them. As their fathers lived
before them, so they do, and will continue to do so for
a long time to come. We gave a few coppers to the poor
wretches to drink our health in pulque, which is excellent
here, the <i>maguey</i> reaching sometimes twenty feet in diameter,
and the leaves nine feet ten inches in length. I am told that
some plants yield as much as 600 litres of liquid. The way
the juice is extracted from the aloe is this: Every five years,
just as the maguey is about to bloom, shooting up a long stalk
crowned with its umbelliferous flowers, the cone forming the
centre of the plant is taken out, leaving a hole, which soon
fills with the sap of the leaves around it. Then a man with
a bottle and a large skin plies daily from plant to plant, taking
up the liquid with the bottle and pouring it into the skin,
which, when full, he empties into an open receptacle, made of
a bull’s hide stretched out on four poles. When the juice is
sufficiently fermented, bitter herbs are added, and the pulque
is then ready for sale.</p>

<p><i>Mezcal</i> is a kind of brandy made from a smaller kind of
aloe, not unlike a huge cabbage in shape. To prepare it, roots
and leaves are left to soak until they are duly fermented; a
calf’s head or the best part of a chicken is added to the compound
previous to distillation. In the first case it is called
<i>mezcal cabecita</i>; in the second, considered the finest in flavour,
<i>mezcal pechuga</i>. The best Indian cognacs are manufactured at
Jalisco.</p>

<p>S. Martin, where we are going to put up for the night, is
situated on the driest spot in the valley, so that the only green
things to be seen about it are its enormous hedges of aloe,
shooting up from fifteen to twenty feet high, and so thick as
to make them quite impassable. Our next stage is S. John
of Teotihuacan, which was formerly a station for the numerous
relays of mules plying to and from Mexico, when more than
two thousand passed daily. Then every village had “mesones”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>
and an immense “corrale,” in which mules, horses, and donkeys
were put up, whence the clapping of hands of the tortilleros
was heard all day long, and copious libations to the Indian
Bacchus were the reverse of edifying. But now all that is
over. The railroad has turned S. Juan into a living tomb.
The plaza is deserted, tiendas are silent, and windows
only open when the tramping of some wretched donkey or a
stray traveller disturb its solitude. Water, that first of commodities,
is plentiful here, and great poplars, beautiful cedars,
lend their cool shade, and make our walk to the church, which
stands at the end of a noble avenue, quite enjoyable. This
church is one of the finest to be seen in Mexico. The steeple,
with its three orders of columns rising on three successive tiers,
is striking for its elegance and fine proportions.</p>

<p>We alight here without much hope of being comfortable, for
the only accommodation is a meson, with a courtyard giving
access to bare rooms paved with bricks, devoid of any furniture,
and where privacy is impossible, for anybody may come and
lie alongside of you. Your ablutions have to be made at the
well in presence of half the village congregated in the yard.
When you are hungry you go to the “fonda” in the plaza, where
the good man who keeps it does his best to cook you a nice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">Pg 140</a></span>dinner, which we eat to spare his feelings rather than because
we like his menu. But if the <i>cuisine</i> left something to be
desired, it was amply made up to us by the Municipality, and
it was owing to their kindly help that we were able, within a
few hours, to muster men in sufficient numbers to begin our
operations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="center">TEOTIHUACAN (continued).</p>

<p class="indent">Ruins of a Teotihuacan Palace—Cemetery—Bull-Fighting—Pits and Quarries—Excavations—A
Toltec Palace—Ants—Ancient Tombs—Sepulchral Stone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> a brief survey I discovered traces of cement, which made
it evident that part of the village is built on the site of the
ancient city; so I made up my mind to try my luck here
before venturing into the very heart of the ruins, which I wished
to take time to study. I began by opening four trenches in
a small square used for bull-fighting, not far from Plaza Mayor.
The first two yielded nothing particular, the next gave more
satisfactory results; for here we came upon some dozen children’s
tombs, and five or six adults’, if we are to judge from vases and
other objects we found, for nothing could be made of the bones,
which crumbled into dust. The few vases we unearthed are made
of black clay, with hollow lines, not unlike those at Tula. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">Pg 142</a></span>
have flat bottoms from six to seven inches wide, with open brims,
and from two to three inches high. Close to them were found
traces of skeletons, which we know to have been those of poor
people, for the bodies of the rich were burnt and their ashes placed
in tombs. The vases were often found in couples; they are
unfortunately so old, the ground is so hard as to form one mass
with the vase, and so notwithstanding all our precautions, all our
care in digging the ground and taking it up with daggers, they
were broken to pieces, and I was only able to save a few. As to
the bodies, they were so far gone, that it was impossible to
ascertain their position; they were generally found from one foot
three inches to one foot nine inches, and three feet three inches
deep. The children were buried in a kind of circular vases, with
upright brims; two of the skeletons were almost perfect, but the
skulls, as thin as a sheet of paper, fell to pieces at my touch. On
the same day I unearthed a goodly number of terra-cotta figures, a
fine moulded mask, an axe, a few pots, one of which is ribbed and
beautifully moulded, a number of small round pebbles, evidently
marbles buried with the children; besides a large quantity of
obsidian knives, by far the finest and lightest I have seen; round
pieces of slate, presumably used as currency, <i>bezotes</i>, rings worn on
the lower lip, arrow-heads, whilst numerous sheets of mica were
found in every tomb.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Among human remains we also noticed
those of the <i>techichi</i>, edible dog, parts of birds, and victuals, to
sustain the dead on his long journey beyond the grave.</p>

<p>Leaving my men under my substitute, I went with Marcelino
a little way beyond the village towards Pachucha, to visit the
cuevas or pits of old quarries, which were subsequently used as
catacombs; they are two miles and a half west of the Pyramid of
the Moon. The first we visit has a circular aperture of considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">Pg 143</a></span>size, with three narrow low galleries branching off in different
directions at an angle of forty to forty-five degrees. The first
explorers of these
caves found
human remains
<span class="figright300" style="width: 300px;">

side by side with
those of ruminants.
The next
cavern, of far
greater dimensions,
is three hundred
and fifty feet
further off. We
enter one of the
galleries, and walk
for ten minutes
before we can see
the end; my guide
assures me that
this gallery extends
as far as the
Pyramid of the
Sun, three miles
beyond; that the
whole country
around is undermined
by these
cuevas, the soil
of which is conglomerate.</p>

<p>We now come to large halls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">Pg 144</a></span>
supported by incredibly small pillars; the population round
about use them as ball-rooms twice a year, and nothing can
give an idea of the almost magic effect they then present. In
this cueva the conglomerate is split up into gigantic isolated
blocks of the most fantastic, weird shapes, in juxtaposition with
a perpendicular calcareous formation. The next cavern we visit
has a well and a rotunda in the centre; ghastly stories are told
of the brigands who formerly used this cueva as a burial-place
for their victims after having plundered them; wild suppositions
which derive a colouring from the numerous human remains
to be found everywhere, which are, however, undoubtedly the
bones of the earlier Indians, as the thickness of the skulls
sufficiently indicates.</p>

<p>From the cuevas we return to the ruins, where I look
forward to bringing to light a house, that I may prove
Teotihuacan to have been as much a Toltec city as Tula.
Whilst casting about where to begin I noticed parts of walls,
broken cement and terraces, north of the river, when forthwith
we cleared away the rubbish until we reached the floor, following
the walls, corners, and openings of the various apartments, as
we had done at Tula; and when three days later the engineer,
Mr. P. Castro, joined us, ten rooms, forming part of the house,
had been unearthed. He was so surprised at our success that,
stopping short, he exclaimed: “Why, it is our Tula palace over
again!”</p>

<p>And so it was—inner court, apartments on different levels,
everything as we had found before, save that here the rooms
were much larger and most supported by pillars; one of these
chambers measures 49 feet on one side, that is 732 feet in
circumference. The walls, nearly six feet seven inches thick, are
built of stone and mortar, incrusted with deep cement, sloping up
about three feet and terminating perpendicularly. The centre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">Pg 145</a></span>
the room is occupied by six pillars, on which rose stone, brick, or
wood columns bearing the roof.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-145.jpg" width="500" height="320" alt="GROUND PLAN OF TOLTEC PALACE AT TEOTIHUACAN." />
<p class="caption">GROUND PLAN OF TOLTEC PALACE AT TEOTIHUACAN.</p></div>

<p>This is undoubtedly a palace, and these are the reception
rooms; the sleeping apartments were behind; unfortunately
they lie under cultivated ground covered with Indian corn,
so we are not permitted to disturb them. In the large room
we observed small stone rings fixed to the wall, and on
each side of the entrance, also fixed to the wall, two small
painted slabs. What had been their use? To support lights at
night? But how was that possible? For even now the only lights
the natives use are <i>ocotes</i>, pieces of resinous wood, whilst the slabs
bear no traces of smoke. I had, it is true, met in the course of
my excavations with terra-cotta objects which might have been
taken for candlesticks, but to which I had attached no importance,
when I suddenly recollected a passage in Sahagun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">Pg 146</a></span>
bearing on the subject: “The chandler who knows how to
do his work first bleaches, cleans and melts the wax, and when
in a liquid state he pours it on a wick and rolls it between two
slabs; he sometimes puts a layer of black wax within a white
layer,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> My first supposition had been right.</p>

<p>Here also the floors and walls are coated with mortar, stucco,
or cement, save that in the dwellings of the rich, necessarily few,
they are ornamented with figures, as principal subject, with a
border like an Aubusson carpet. The colours are not all effaced,
red, black, blue, yellow, and white, are still discernible; a few
examples of these frescoes are to be seen in the Trocadéro. I am
convinced that numerous treasures might be brought to light were
regular excavations to be made, but the Mexican Government,
which would have most interest in such a work, does not seem to
care to undertake it.</p>

<p>Leaving my men under the direction of Colonel Castro,
I return to the “Path of Death,” composed of a great number
of small mounds, <i>Tlateles</i>, the tombs of great men. They are
arranged symmetrically in avenues terminating at the sides of
the great pyramids, on a plain of some 620 feet to 975 feet in
length; fronting them are cemented steps, which must have been
used as seats by the spectators during funeral ceremonies or
public festivities. On the left, amidst a mass of ruins, are broken
pillars, said to have belonged to a temple; the huge capitals
have some traces of sculpture. Next comes a quadrangular
block, of which a cast is to be found in the main gallery of the
Trocadéro.</p>

<p>In the course of my excavations I had found now and again
numerous pieces of worked obsidian, precious stones, beads, etc.,
within the circuit of ants’ nests, which these busy insects had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">Pg 147</a></span>extracted from the ground in digging their galleries; and now on
the summit of the lesser pyramid I again came upon my friends,
and among the things I picked out of their nests was a perfect
earring of obsidian, very small and as thin as a sheet of paper. It
is not so curious as it seems at first, for we are disturbing a ground
formed by fifty generations.</p>

<p>Glass does not seem to have been known to the Indians, for
although Tezcatlipoca was often figured with a pair of spectacles,
they may only have been figurative ones like those of the
manuscripts, terra-cotta, or bassi-rilievi, for there is nothing to show
that they had any idea of optics.</p>

<p>I now went back to my men, when to my great delight I found
they had unearthed two large slabs showing the entrance of two
sepulchres; they were the first I had yet found, and considering
them very important, I immediately telegraphed to Messrs.
Chavero and Berra, both of whom are particularly interested in
American archæology. I expected to see them come by the very
next train, to view not only the tombstones, but also the palace,
which attracted a great number of visitors; but to my surprise one
sent word that he had a headache, whilst the other pleaded a less
poetic ailment. <i>Ab uno disce omnes</i>; most American writers speak
of ancient monuments from hearsay—from foreign travelers who
have visited them—they never having taken the trouble to travel
any distance to see them.</p>

<p>One of the slabs closed a vault, and the other a cave with
perpendicular walls; we went down the former by a flight of steps
in fairly good condition, yet it was a long and rather dangerous
affair, for we were first obliged to demolish a wall facing us, in
which we found a skull, before we could get to the room which
contained the tombs. The vases within them are exactly like
those we found in the plaza, except that one is filled with a fatty
substance—like burnt flesh—mixed with some kind of stuff, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">Pg 148</a></span>
woof of which is still discernible, besides beads of serpentine, bones
of dogs and squirrels, knives of obsidian twisted by the action of fire.
We know from Sahagun that the dead were buried with their
clothes and their dogs to guide and defend them in their long
journey: “When the dead were ushered into the presence of the
king of the nether world, <i>Mictlantecutli</i>, they offered him papers,
bundles of sticks, pine-wood and perfumed reeds, together with
loosely twisted threads of white and red cotton, a manta, a maxtli,
tunics, and shirts. When a woman died her whole wardrobe was
carefully put aside, and a portion burnt eighty days after; this
operation was repeated on that day twelve months for four years,
when everything that had belonged to the deceased was finally
consumed. The dead then came out of the first circle to go
successively through nine others encompassed by a large river.
On its banks were a number of dogs which helped their owners to
cross the river; whenever a ghost neared the bank, his dog
immediately jumped into the river and swam by his side or carried
him to the opposite bank.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> It was on this account that Indians
had always several small dogs about them.</p>

<p>The speech which was addressed to the dead when laid out
previous to being buried is so remarkable as to make one
suspect that the author unconsciously added something of his
own: “Son, your earthly hardships and sufferings are over.
We are but mortal, and it has pleased the Lord to call you to
himself. We had the privilege of being intimately acquainted
with you; but now you share the abode of the gods, whither
we shall all follow, for such is the destiny of man. The place
is large enough to receive every one; but although all are
bound for the gloomy bourn, none ever return.” Then followed
the speech addressed to the nearest kinsman of the dead: “O
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">Pg 149</a></span>son, cheer up; eat, drink, and let not your mind be cast down.
Against the divine fiat who can contend? This is not of man’s
doing; it is the Lord’s. Take comfort to bear up against the
evils of daily life; for who is able to add a day, an hour, to
his existence? Cheer up, therefore, as becomes a man.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">VOTIVE STONES, TEOTIHUACAN.</p></div>

<p>But to return to our tombstones. They are both alike,
being about five feet high, three feet five inches broad, and six
inches and a half thick. The upper side is smooth, the lower
has some carving in the shape of a cross, four big tears or drops
of water, and a pointed tongue in the centre, which, starting
from the bottom of the slab, runs up in a line parallel to the
drops.</p>

<p>Knowing how general was the worship of Tlaloc among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">Pg 150</a></span>the Indians, I conjectured this had been a monument to the
god of rain, to render him propitious to the dead; a view
shared and enlarged upon by Dr. Hamy in a paper read before
the Académie des Sciences in November, 1882; and that I
should be in accord with the eminent specialist on American
antiquities is a circumstance to make me proud. I may add
that the carving of this slab is similar to that of the cross on
the famous basso-rilievo at Palenque; so that the probability
of the two monuments having been erected to the god of rain
is much strengthened thereby.</p>

<p>As our slabs are far more archaic than those at Palenque,
we think we are justified in calling them earlier in time—the
parent samples of the later ones. Nor is our assumption unsupported,
for we shall subsequently find that the cult of Tlaloc
and Quetzalcoatl was carried by the Toltecs in their distant
peregrinations. These slabs, therefore, and the pillars we found
in the village, acquire a paramount importance in establishing
the affiliation of Toltec settlements in Tabasco, Yucatan, and
other places, furnishing us with further data in regard to certain
monuments at Palenque, the steles of Tikal, and the massive
monolith idols of Copan.</p>

<p>I next attacked the terraced court fronting the palace towards
the Path of Death, and the amount of constructions and substructures
we came upon is almost beyond belief: inclined
stuccoed walls crossing each other in all directions, flights of
steps leading to terraces within the pyramid, ornaments, pottery,
and detritus; so much so that the pyramid might not improperly
be called a necropolis, in which the living had their dwellings.</p>

<p>In a word, our campaign at Teotihuacan was as successful
as our campaign at Tula. We were attended by the same good
fortune, and the reader whom such things may interest will find
a bas-relief of both Toltec palaces, and of one of the tombstones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">Pg 151</a></span>
in the Trocadéro. The other I offered, as in duty bound, to
the Mexican Government, which allowed it to remain in the
village for eighteen months, when Mr. Cumplido, the editor
of the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, had it brought to Mexico, and sold
it to the Museum for £10.</p>

<p>From what has been said it will be seen that the monuments
at Teotihuacan were partly standing at the time of the Conquest.</p>

<p>Our next investigations will take us to the Sierra.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="center">MOUNTAIN EXPLORATION.</p>

<p class="indent">Travelling Companions—S. Lazarus Station—S. Anita—Ayotla—Tlalmanalco—Tenango
del Aire—Amecameca—A Badly Lighted Town—Rateros—Monte-Sacro—Volcaneros.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> my first visit to the country, three-and-twenty years before, I
had gone to the Sierra for the purpose of making a collection of
photographs of Popocatepetl and the hills surrounding it. As my
men were getting my camera ready I amused myself in scratching
the ground with my stick, when, to my great surprise, I discovered
a bit of pottery and presently a whole vase; I next tried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">Pg 153</a></span>
ground with my dagger and unearthed more vases, side by side
with human remains. At that time, however, I was so absorbed
by my photography, so ill prepared for gauging the importance of
monuments and objects of antiquity regarding the country I was
visiting, that I did not follow up my discovery; but now, deeply
conscious of their interest, I returned to Popocatepetl, in the hope
of finding the place as I had left it, and to be able to bring to light
its hidden treasures.</p>

<p>Before going any further I wish to make the reader acquainted
with my travelling companions. First in rank and importance
stands Don Perez Castro, a Colonel of the Artillery, appointed
by the Mexican Government to watch and share my labours and
discoveries. Colonel Castro has taken part in all the battles and
combats of his country during the Franco-Austrian empire of
Maximilian; he is used to every climate, always ready to make the
best of everything, blessed, moreover, with a perfect temper, a
thorough good fellow, a caballero of the old school, with whom it
is impossible not to get on. Next comes my private secretary,
young Albert Lemaire, a promising topographer, a good draughtsman,
who accepts cheerfully the hardships, privations, nay, the
occasional perils of the expedition. Our servant, Julian Diaz,
completes the list. He is a good specimen of a Calino, sweet-tempered,
obliging, devoted, and indefatigable, and as simple and
guileless as a child; he is never seen without his faithful dog
d’Artagnan, a fine-looking animal, far too lazy to be any good
against thieves or in the pursuit of game.</p>

<p>S. Lazarus is the station of a new line connecting Mexico
with Morelos and Amecameca; here travellers must beware of the
“cargadores,” who swoop down on the luggage like birds of prey,
and if they are not more than quick in protecting their traps they
will, in all probability, never see them again. Poor Julian learnt
it to his cost, for in spite of all our vigilance, our fighting, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">Pg 154</a></span>
rushing madly after our porters not to lose sight of our things,
when we reached the platform Julian’s trunk was gone. I was
indignant, but he took his mischance quite philosophically, as
though it did not concern him, lighting his cigar and taking
his seat without a word of reproach against his unscrupulous
countrymen.</p>

<p>The guard gives the signal, the whistle is heard, and we
steam out of this squalid station, following the road by which
Cortez entered Mexico. In the time of the Aztecs it was
planted with beautiful trees, a glowing vegetation and pleasant
groves clad the borders of the lake, over which glided a thousand
light skiffs and floating chinampas; but now the waters which
penetrated the city everywhere have receded so far as to be
hardly visible, and the bright towns and hamlets, once washed
by them, have been removed miles inland, leaving a barren
strip of land with incrustations of salt on the surface. It is
refreshing to abandon this unhealthy, horrible swamp to skirt
S. Anita’s Canal, with its grassy banks, great trees, pretty
villas, and blooming gardens overlooking the water. We perceive
a few Indians among the reeds of the muddy waters
casting their small nets to get a white fish to be found here.
We pass Peñon with its sulphureous springs, stop at Santa
Marta, once the culminating point of the road, and we shall
soon leave behind the basin of the lake once so animated, so
full of life, but now mournful and desolate beyond redemption.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, with amazing stupidity, even since my first
visit, have laid low the forests of sombre pines and ilexes which
shrouded the slopes of the volcanic hills occupying the valley,
and imparting to it so unique a character; and now torrential
rains carry away the soil no longer held by roots, leaving the
rocks bare, so that nothing grows excepting the prickly pear
or the funereal opuntiums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">Pg 155</a></span></p>

<p>It is not very difficult to see where this state of things will
end. We can approximately calculate the time when the requirements
of the railway will attack the rare forests as yet
crowning the higher hills, and their summits be denuded also!</p>

<p>After Ayotla
the landscape
somewhat improves.
<span class="figright300" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-155.jpg" width="300" height="449" alt="SANTA ANITA CANAL." /><br />
<span class="caption">SANTA ANITA CANAL.</span></span>
We begin
to see a few gardens,
a few olive-trees,
immense
plantations of aloe,
affording at once
drink and raiment,
yellow maize ready
to be gathered before
the impending
rains. We are
approaching the
mountains and
have passed Compañia
and Lake
Chalco on our
right, and go
through Rio Frio,
once a favourite station
for brigands.
On my first journey I fell a prey to them with a diligence
full of people, when like a flock of sheep we all stood to
be plundered by two wretched-looking fellows one could have
brought down at one blow. At that time, however, it was deemed
wise to offer no resistance, for fear of unseen companions lurking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">Pg 156</a></span>
close by. Now Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, bearing to heaven
their snowy peaks, become more and more distinct; here is Tematla,
and a few minutes more bring us to Tenango del Aire, “windy,”
where violent winds generally prevail. The line here leaves the old
road which used to pass Tlalmanal, and for my part I regret it, as
I miss seeing the remains of a convent built in the first years
of the Conquest, which was never finished.</p>

<p>The ruins are composed of fragments of walls with a portico
formed by five arches, supported by slender columns as finely
sculptured as a Chinese ivory casket. Indian artists executed
this beautiful carving after designs furnished by the Catholic
Spaniards. I am told by the guard that when this line was open,
hundreds of vases, statuettes, pottery of every shape and size were
unearthed, none of which found their way to the Museum, the
officials having shared the spoil among themselves. It is grievous
to think that so many precious objects are lost to science, when it
would be so easy for the Mexican Government to introduce a
clause by which the contractors bound themselves to give up to
the authorities any antiquities they happened to bring to light.</p>

<p>It was seven o’clock when we entered the station of Amecameca,
having been four hours in performing a journey of some
sixty-four miles. It was now pitch dark, so that our luggage was
piled into the cart without our examining it, and it was not until
we were in the house which was to take us in, there being no
hotel in the place, that I perceived both locks of my portmanteau
had been broken and £20 out of £60 taken. I naturally
complained to the authorities, but as I could not say where the
theft had taken place (though it must have been accomplished
either at the station in Mexico or in the train) I obtained no
redress, and I comforted myself with the thought that it would
have been much worse had they taken the whole.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-157.jpg" width="500" height="316" alt="AMECAMECA." />
<p class="caption">AMECAMECA.</p></div>

<p>Amecameca is situated at an altitude of 626 feet above Mexico,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">Pg 157</a><br /><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">Pg 158</a><br /><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">Pg 159</a></span>at the foot of Monte-Sacro, planted with beautiful trees; the air
is cool even in summer and the climate good. This circumstance
has made it a favourite resort for the rich Mexicans eager to
escape from the excessive heat of the plain. But even in this
favoured climate storms, rain, and winds prevail during several
months of the year; hence perpendicular roofs have replaced
azoteas, giving it the aspect of an Alpine village. No more
enchanting scenery can well be imagined: to the south-east, great
Popocatepetl rises to the enormous height of 17,852 feet above
the level of the sea; fronting it to the east Iztaccihuatl, 15,208
feet, spreading its mantle of snow over its broad surface; and if
yielding in bulk and height to its gigantic neighbour it is far more
picturesque, surrounded by a belt of hills, with a thousand fantastic
forms, broken peaks, massive rocks, and deep ravines, presenting
a variety and richness of colouring unsurpassed anywhere. In the
morning the plain is covered with a slight white mist, like a bridal
veil, through which show the tapering stalks of Indian corn and
the gloomy masses of trees. In this light the lower hills are of a
tender peacock-green, deepening to the darkest blue in the
barrancas, whilst the crests are tinged with a faint blush; but
when storms, at this season very frequent, burst upon the gigantic
and broken surface of these mountains, when clouds sweep
across their slopes clashing against each other, and the lightning
illumines the whole sky, when the thunder is re-echoed from all
these peaks, from all these pinnacles, to die in the distant ravines,
one understands how a primitive race peopled Popocatepetl with
giants and evil spirits, whose agonies in their prison-house found
expression in these convulsions of nature. But if at this season
we have a succession of thunderstorms and torrential rains, if the
sky is overcast at night and white exhalations rise from the plain,
the mornings are bright and wonderfully calm.</p>

<p>The Municipality took measures some time since to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">Pg 160</a></span>
Amecameca, which numbers 1,500 inhabitants, lighted with
petroleum, their finances precluding gas; but, alas! they had
counted without the <i>rateros</i>, who on the very first night spread
over the city, put out simultaneously all the lamps and carried
them off. But I hear some one ask, what is a <i>ratero</i>? A ratero
is ubiquitous and essentially an American institution. His strength
as a thief lies in being a member of a very “long firm.” He is
always to be found in crowds, whether in the market-place,
church, or theatre; he penetrates ill-closed houses, whence he
takes anything valuable; he strips railway carriages of their
fixtures, and railways of their wooden rails—the largest beams are
not safe from his grasp; horses and cattle are frequently driven
from one district to be sold in another by the ratero. Rateros
hardly ever miss a party crossing the Cordilleras, and they take
care to be in sufficient numbers to ensure victory. It was a ratero
who carried off Julian’s box, and a ratero had eased me of £20.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">Pg 161</a></span></p>

<p>The immediate attraction of Amecameca is Monte-Sacro, a
volcanic hill, fire-rent, rising from the centre of the town to a
height of 325 feet. There is a grotto which was turned into
a hermitage at the time of the Conquest. The place soon acquired
great celebrity for holiness on account of miracles which were
performed thereat; chapels, churches, and a good road with the
twelve stations of the Cross, were erected by the piety and for the
accommodation of devotees who came hither from all parts, and
who, not satisfied with visiting the Monte-Sacro during their
lifetime, often desired to be buried in the cemetery fronting the
church, so that it is over-crowded.</p>

<p>The tombs are covered with cement and perfectly flat, with
rude drawings made by the friends of the dead, who scratch
with their hands and bare feet certain figures whilst the plaster
is soft; but although I inquired of several people, I could obtain
no satisfactory answer regarding the origin of this peculiar
custom. The branches of the surrounding trees, as indeed
those on the road up to the Cross, are hung with ex-votos
of the oddest description: small crosses, bits of thread, coloured
stuff, dead flowers, tangled hair, reminding one of offerings
around Japanese temples. The view from the top of the hill
is very fine and extensive, and the ascent has been made
both easy and pleasant by a winding road planted with cypress
trees to the north, and to the south side with ilexes of enormous
size.</p>

<p>We were detained here by the weather, which was simply
abominable, and also by the difficulty of procuring saddle-horses,
mules to carry our baggage, and men inured by long
experience to live and work in this rarefied atmosphere.</p>

<p>It was not without a feeling of deep satisfaction that we
saw our last mule and our last man loaded ready to start.
Our two best men are brothers, both of whom have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">Pg 162</a></span>
employed in the sulphur-mines of Popocatepetl, one as foreman
for the last eight-and-twenty years, and the other even
longer. The five remaining Indians are also “volcaneros,”
accustomed to live at an altitude of 13,000 to 17,550 feet
above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>At last every man is at his post, and we begin slowly the
ascent of the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a good horse and a comfortable saddle, the ascent of
Popocatepetl is a delightful ride. The road rises so rapidly
that the view, which was confined to the charming valley of
Amecameca, becomes finer and more extensive at every turn
of the road, embracing at last the entire plateau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">Pg 164</a></span></p>

<p>The air is crisp, the sun, though hot, is bearable, and when,
after three hours’ march, we reach the high mountain ridge, we
pause to admire in silence the finest panorama in the world:
the two great volcanoes to our right and left, the plain of
Puebla on our rear, whilst before us stretches the marvellous
plain of Mexico, every detail of which is distinctly visible in
this clear atmosphere.</p>

<p>We are so lost in contemplation that the guide has at last to
remind us that, unless we resume our march, we shall be late
for luncheon, which awaits us at Tlamacas; but when we did
reach it we found that the only accommodation to be had
was a shed, open to rain, wind, and cold. There was fortunately
a table and a chimney, and with our camp-beds we managed
pretty well.</p>

<p>As soon as we had seen to our luggage we sallied forth in
search of the cemetery under the escort of the chief guide,
and began the ascent of Monte del Fraile, 782 feet high, over
a distance of three miles. This may appear a small matter—but
a short walk; yet a climb performed at an altitude of
13,000 feet on moving sand, every step of which is painful,
is no joke: the head aches, the pulse throbs, every breath
drawn is a gasp, the throat is dry, every attempt to stoop
makes one dizzy, rest becomes necessary every few minutes;
and on reaching the crest of Tenenepanco rock we were
thoroughly exhausted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-165.jpg" width="500" height="355" alt="POPOCATEPETL AND PICO DEL FRAILE." />
<p class="caption">POPOCATEPETL AND PICO DEL FRAILE.</p></div>

<p>My impatience to find the cemetery was so great, that I
could not stop long to contemplate the fine view to be seen
here; we immediately began our search. But though I seemed
to recognise the plateau, it looked somewhat different—strewn
with flat stones I had not observed before—consequently I
climbed higher, followed by an old Indian who had been with
me in my first expedition, and who opened the ground in several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">Pg 165</a><br /><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">Pg 166</a><br /><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">Pg 167</a></span>places. It was found very hard, compact, gravelly, without
any appearance of ever having been disturbed; so after many
fruitless attempts, I returned to the first place, when the old
Indian, who had not breathed a word hitherto, said:</p>

<p>“Señor, this is the place where you found some vases the
last time you were here.”</p>

<p>“But how do these flags come here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, from subsequent excavations.”</p>

<p>“Then I am sold, robbed, done out of my find,” I cried in
my disappointment, as though the cemetery were my property.</p>

<p>“But,” objected the old volcanero softly, “only a few loads
of detritus were taken away; there must be more to come out.”</p>

<p>Acting on advice which seemed so reasonable, I soon discovered
numerous <i>tepalcates</i>, fragments of vases, cups, and
various potteries; we had lost so much time, however, in
looking about, that we were soon obliged to abandon the
mountain, trusting in what the morrow would bring forth.</p>

<p>A few words about our encampment may not be out of place
here. The men occupied an open shed, with a huge chimney
in the centre, where twice a day they prepared their own food,
consisting of a small quantity of meat and the indispensable
tortilla, the whole washed down with a good drop of mezcal.
They slept on trusses of dry grass and mats. We were not
better housed than the men, whilst our cooking was a great
deal worse; if our shed was not quite so open, it was sufficiently
so to admit the bitter night cold; the wind came in at all the
windows unprotected by any shutters, through the thousand
cracks of the ill-jointed enclosure, searing our faces and causing
incessant sneezing. Although whole trees were burnt in the
huge chimney, it made no appreciable difference in the atmosphere
of the room, and as there was no tunnel we were
nearly suffocated by the smoke, which, hovering about us, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">Pg 168</a></span>
escaped through the roof. At this altitude, with six or seven
degrees below zero (Centigrade) at night, our bed of guttapercha
felt like icicles, and every time I came in direct contact
with it, I instantly awoke.</p>

<p>The food was plentiful, for the Tlacualero, our “errand-man,”
went twice a day to Amecameca to fetch what was required
for the whole party; and although the distance was fifteen
leagues over a mountain path, I never knew him late. But if
provisions were abundant, Julian’s cooking was so extraordinarily
bad, that the only one who seemed to enjoy and thrive on it
was the dog d’Artagnan; to him it was a matter of indifference
if cutlets and beefsteaks were burnt to a cinder, if beans were
transformed into sticks—nothing came amiss. As for us, not
wishing to starve, we were obliged at last to do the cooking
ourselves and confine our Calino to “washing up.” Not that
he was a bad fellow, far from it; he deserved in every respect
the excellent character I had received with him for honesty,
but a man may have given satisfaction as a sacristan, as no
doubt he had, and yet be a sorry cook.</p>

<p>The chill nights were certainly trying, but they were made up
to us by the glorious mornings; we rose with the first light of day;
the sun, still invisible to us, was already greeting the summit of the
great volcano, from which rose a light vapour. We watched the
snow changing from a delicate pink to dazzling white; the crest of
El Fraile, as yet wrapped in nocturnal mists, showed gray against
a transparent blue sky, whilst its base, shrouded by a deep fringe
of funeral pines, gradually emerged from their gloom at the sun’s
magic touch. To the east the plain of Puebla, and far away on the
horizon the imposing cone of Orizaba, whilst in the middle
distance the severe outline of Malinche seemed to divide the
sky. The city de los Angeles, with her square massive buildings,
her steeples, cupolas, the towers of the cathedral, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">Pg 169</a></span>
stately pyramid of Cholula rose at our feet bathed in a flood of
morning light.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">VASES FOUND AT TENENEPANCO.</p></div>

<p>The old Indian proved a true prophet; my predecessors had
not removed everything; trenches branching off in every direction
so as to embrace the whole plateau were at once made and brought
to light wholly undisturbed tombs. The first was that of a woman
whose head I was able to preserve intact: the bones of all the
rest were unfortunately reduced to a gelatinous paste. The dead
were buried at a depth varying from some two feet to four feet
eight inches; the bodies doubled up, both chin and arms resting
on their knees; hands and feet were gone. Within the tomb, over
the head, was a <i>sebile</i>, or hollow terra-cotta plate, two small black
earthen horns, besides several vases. The whole was damp and
moist, the vases filled with earth and water, and the utmost care
was required in taking up such fragile objects. They soon,
however, hardened by exposure, when they could be easily and
safely cleaned and packed. As far as could be judged from the
bones and pottery, one of the tombs contained the bodies of a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">Pg 170</a></span>
and a woman. Another, probably that of a chief, had no human
remains left, but I found a great variety of precious objects, made
of <i>chalchihuitl</i>, a hard green stone, which takes a fine polish, a
kind of jade or serpentine, much valued by the Indians; besides
these were numerous arrows of obsidian, beads for necklaces, some
of hard stone, some of terra-cotta, and a few small figures. A
singular circumstance marked this tomb; not a single bead, not a
single ornament but was broken, presumably at the time of the
burial, as a token of grief. It is at least the only plausible solution
which can be given for so many hard and resisting objects having
been systematically destroyed.</p>

<p>Moreover, by far the largest proportion of these granite or
porphyry beads, whether owing to their great antiquity or their
having lain in a very destructive soil, crumbled away at our
touch. Broadly speaking, the tombs which had not been
disturbed were two to one; the dead had been buried without
any regard to their position.</p>

<p>We are not yet inured to our life at an altitude of 13,000 feet,
and our daily ascensions are painful in the extreme; our faces
literally peel in this sharp wind and hot sun, whilst our hands are
frightfully chapped, and almost paralysed. It would be difficult to
bear up long against our hardships were it not for the stupendous
result of our excavations: kitchen utensils, every variety of vases
representing the Toltec god Tlaloc, fruit cups, jewel cups, with
feet shaped like a duck’s bill or a boar’s head; chocolate cups
with porpoise-like handles; beads, jewels, a whole civilisation
emerges from these tombs, and carries us back to the life
of this long-forgotten people. Here we have caricatures of
ancient warriors; further on a water-carrier bearing his jars like
the modern “aguadores;” next are toys and tiny terra-cotta
chariots, some are broken, some still preserve their four wheels;
they were, presumably, a fond mother’s memento who, ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">Pg 171</a></span>
gone by, buried them with her beloved child. These chariots
are shaped like a flattened <i>cayote</i> (a kind of long-bodied fox)
with its straight ears and pointed face, and the wheels fit into
four terra-cotta stumps; on my renewing the wood axle-tree,
which had been destroyed long since, the chariots began to move.</p>

<p>Many more objects were brought to light from these tombs—richly
<span class="figright300" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-171.jpg" width="300" height="390" alt="CARICATURE OF TECUHTLI-KNIGHT" />
<span class="caption">CARICATURE OF TECUHTLI-KNIGHT (KNIGHT OF THE EAGLE).</span></span>
ornamented
“fusaïoles,” marbles,
necklaces, baby-tables,
which, like the
toy chariots, represented
some quadruped—resembling
Greek toys. This
coincidence between
people so different
and so far removed
from each other is not
surprising, for elementary
ideas generally
find a common
expression. It should
also be observed that
these toys, however
rude, do not necessarily mark a very ancient epoch. Early
manifestations live on through ages and are found side by side
with the highest civilisations, and are still to be met among the
people long after the well-to-do possess objects of art.</p>

<p>The 9th of July was one of our best days. Out of ten tombs
five were found intact and yielded sixty remarkable pieces, one of
which is unique and of peculiar interest. It is a three-footed
terra-cotta cup some six inches by three by one and a half at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">Pg 172</a></span>
bottom inside; wonderful to relate, it emerged without a blot from
its gloomy abode. Both the inside and outside are covered with
pretty devices painted white, yellow, blue, green, and red, fused
into a harmonious whole. The colours are in relief and like
enamels. Next, one almost as beautiful but smaller, and covered
with dirt, was found. These two lovely cups were put out to dry
in the sun, when, to my horror, I saw that one was fast scaling off,
whilst the brilliant colours of the other were fading visibly. To
remove them into the shade was the work of an instant, but, alas!
it did not arrest the work of destruction, which continued at an
alarming pace. A photograph of the finest cup, as well as the
colours of the paintings, was immediately obtained, but it only
gives a faint idea of the beauty of this charming work of art.</p>

<p>From these tombs were likewise unearthed a number of
diminutive brass bells, which were used both as ornaments and
currency; besides large fat vases with a hand painted red over a
black ground. This was a Toltec memento, either symbolic of
Hueman or of Quetzalcoatl, so often seen on the walls of Yucatec
palaces, and likewise on the monuments of some North American
tribes. But our most curious “find” was a perfectly well-preserved
human brain, the skull of which was gone. This
cerebral mass had been protected from the pressure of its
surroundings by a stout cup into which it was wedged. No doubt
was possible: the two lobes, the circumvolution of the brain to the
minute red lines of the blood-vessels, all was there.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-173.jpg" width="500" height="484" alt="BOTTOM OF ENAMELLED CUP FOUND IN THE BURIAL-GROUND." />
<p class="caption">BOTTOM OF ENAMELLED CUP FOUND IN THE BURIAL-GROUND.</p></div>

<p>The fact that a human brain could have been found in good
preservation when the skull had disappeared, was received with
Homeric laughter; all I can say is that it is so, that the finding of it
was witnessed by my associates; that in every tomb where the skull
should have been, was invariably observed a whitish substance,
which at first was mistaken for lime, but which subsequently
whenever it was met with, the men instantly cried out: “<i>Aqui</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">Pg 173</a></span>
<i>està uno</i>—here is one” (body), and near it vases and fragments
clearly indicating the presence of a tomb. These brains, however,
not having been protected like the first, were all flattened into a
white cake of some five inches by two in thickness. The only
explanation I can offer is that at an elevation of 13,000 feet, close
to the volcanic cone of Popocatepetl, in a soil saturated with
sulphureous vapours (a film of sulphide always extended over my
nitrate of silver washes), the same chemical combinations which
destroyed the bones, may have acted as a preservative on
cerebral matter. But it will be asked, why not have borne
away that wonderful brain? I ought to have done so, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">Pg 174</a></span>
doubt, but without alcohol the thing was impossible; besides,
had I done so, should I have a better chance of convincing people
at a distance?</p>

<p>The toy chariots found no better favour with the public.
Our illustrations, however, will settle once for all this vexed
question. As must appear to the most inexperienced eye, the
character of these toys is exceedingly archaic, nor am I aware
that any museum or private collection has anything to show
at all approaching them. This was conceded, but it was denied
that they were chariots at all—the wheels were only “malacates,”
<i>i.e.</i> “fusaïoles”! Numerous spindles were indeed found by
us in the cemetery. Profuse collections may be seen and compared
in every museum, when the most ignorant must see
that these wheels are quite different to “fusaïoles” or whorls.
It will be said that this toy was but the copy of a chariot
brought in by the Spaniards; but a glance at the drawing
will show how absurd is the assumption, and carry conviction
to the most incredulous.</p>

<p>Granted that is so, what inference do you draw from it?
That the Mexicans had chariots? Hardly, since all authorities
are silent on the subject, and when we know that the only
means of transportation was afforded by carriers. But if such
chariots were not available in distant expeditions across rivers,
over mountain paths, through immense forests, it was not so
within the radius of a city having good roads; and what is
there against the possibility of a hand-cart corresponding with
ours having been in use?</p>

<p>I am far from affirming that it was so, although certain
expressions and quotations might be adduced which would show
the supposition to be not so far-fetched as it looks on the face
of it. We read in the Ramirez manuscript, for instance, that
Montezuma II. set out for his Huaxateca expedition with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">Pg 175</a></span>
numerous army and <i>carruages</i>.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> Why should the Indian writer
have used an ambiguous word meaning both <i>chariot</i> and <i>transport</i>,
when the former must already have been extant when he
wrote—that is, after the Conquest? Farther, Padre Duran
relates how this same Montezuma, wishing to erect a temalacatl,
had a huge block quarried at Aculco, near Amecameca; and
Plate XXV. shows this block raised by means of a rude chariot
having clog-wheels, drawn by a multitude of Indians.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> The text,

<span class="caption">CARTS, CHILDREN’S TOYS.</span></span>
it is true, does not
specify a chariot;
but if they were
unknown, how do
they come in his
drawing? It is
unaccountable, too,
that no mention
is made of the
stone having been
brought on rollers
or wheels, seeing
that it could not
have come so
great a distance by any other means. It is altogether a
mystery.</p>

<p>Lastly, Juarros, in describing the battle at Pinar, fought
against Alvarado, mentions war-engines, or what would now
be called ammunition carts, moving on <i>rodadillos</i>, which were
drawn by armed men wherever they were required. These
carts were loaded with arrows, spears, shields, stones, slings,
etc., and men, chosen for the service, distributed them as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">Pg 176</a></span>were wanted.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Does “rodadillo” mean here a clog-wheel or a
roller? If these carts carried arms to combatants in different
parts of the field of battle, does it not follow that they moved
on wheels, since rollers would have made the diminutive “forts”
immovable, contrary to the end proposed?</p>

<p>Should, however, both quotations and arguments seem valueless,
it might be added that the toy chariots were perhaps of
primeval Toltec invention, the use of which had been lost after
their expulsion from the plateaux.</p>

<p>But to return to the cemetery. Whether it be considered
Toltec or otherwise, whether ancient or comparatively modern,
we hold to its antiquity, to its being essentially Nahua, dedicated
to Tlaloc, the god of rain and plenty, the fertiliser of the earth,
the Lord of Paradise, the protector of green harvests. We are
in his dominions, for he was believed to reside where the clouds
gather, on the highest mountain-tops.</p>

<p>The first plate shows the vases unearthed at Tenenepanco,
five of which portray this god, with his prominent eyes, the drops
of water streaming down his face, making up his teeth, his beard
or moustachios; he holds in his right hand a writhing serpent,
thereby representing the flash and the thunderbolt—his voice as
heard in storms. In the Nahualac Plate four vases also figure the
same god.</p>

<p>The nations who succeeded the Toltecs on the plateaux
adopted this eminently Toltec deity, who was one of the most
popular gods down to the Conquest. The later tribes, however,
discarding the mild practices of the Toltecs, stained his cult
with human sacrifices. We will add a few quotations showing
how great was the analogy between the places consecrated to
Tlaloc and the Tenenepanco cemetery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">Pg 177</a></span></p>

<p>Torquemada calls him the god of paradise and great delights;
that his statue on the highest mountain of Texcuco represented
a man seated on a square slab, having at the back a huge stone
jar, into which <i>ulli</i>, maize, beans, and other vegetables were
placed by the devotees, and that this offering was renewed every
year. Ixtlilxochitl mentions, <i>inter alia</i>, that five or six young
children were yearly sacrificed to this deity, their hearts torn out,
and their bodies buried; and we read in Father Duran that
Montezuma and the allied princes repaired on the hill on which
a child seven or eight years old was sacrificed. This festival was
<span class="figright300" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-177.jpg" width="300" height="124" alt="VASES OF BURIAL-GROUND UNEARTHED AT NAHUALAC." />
<span class="caption">VASES OF BURIAL-GROUND UNEARTHED AT NAHUALAC.</span></span>
celebrated in the
month of April,
when the maize
was above the
ground. The next
quotation from
Torquemada is by
far the most interesting,
for it mentions Popocatepetl and the surrounding hills
where we are carrying on our explorations:</p>

<p>“Indians entertained a great respect for this mountain, whose
climate was mild, and the abundance of whose waters made the
land around unusually fertile, and here children and slaves were
slain in honour of Tlaloc. To the south is another mighty hill,
Teocuinani, ‘the Divine Singer,’ so called by the natives because
whenever the clouds shroud its summit the volcano bursts forth
in flashes of lightning and claps of thunder, spreading terror
among the whole population, who hasten to the hill to offer men,
incense, paper-crowns, feathers, <i>plates</i>, <i>urns</i>, <i>goblets</i>, <i>cups</i>, <i>toys</i>,
<i>and vases</i>” (exactly what we have found). “Close by was a
well-constructed house, <i>Ayauchcalli</i>, ‘house of rest,’ in which
stood an idol of green stone, <i>chalchihuitl</i>, about the size of a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">Pg 178</a></span>
eight years old. On the arrival of the Spaniards this idol
was carried away and buried <i>in the mountains</i> by the Indians,
together with numerous objects of gold, silver, and precious
stones.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>We have often seen clouds collected around the top of Teocuinani
(El Fraile), and many a time have we heard the dread
voice of the Divine Singer; if our Tenenepanco cemetery is not
the one spoken of by Father Duran, it is assuredly its nearest
neighbour, and we are convinced that this site was once sacred
to Tlaloc, consequently ancient, and that besides the victims
sacrificed, both men and women were buried here as in consecrated
ground, with their utensils, arms, and ornaments.</p>

<p>The foregoing quotations prove, moreover, that the surrounding
mountains contain several funeral stations, which might be
profitably explored; Mount Tlaloc alone would enrich the most
greedy. As for us, we are satisfied with having discovered two
and opened the way to others; and when we add that our
excavations yielded three hundred and seventy pieces, our self-satisfaction
will not appear out of place. The greatest care was
taken in packing our treasure in four large <i>huacales</i>, “cases,” and
the freight reached safely Amecameca and Mexico, where the
Government confiscated it.</p>

<p>In our two years’ explorations the Mexican Museum had
deducted a third from the best of our finds; now they illegally
detained the whole, refusing to give up any part of it. Let future
explorers do their work quietly, offering nothing to the Republic,
which might adopt, as in our case, a singular mode of testifying its
gratitude.</p>

<p>The next day after our return to the village, we set out for the
Mispayantla grottoes, accompanied by a guide and three Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">Pg 179</a></span>provided with tools. These grottoes are situated in the barranca
known as Mispayantla, at once the most picturesque and the most
important in the Mexican Valley, extending from El Fraile to the
east and west as far as the Amecan Valley. From rocks rising
perpendicularly to some six hundred and nine hundred feet, the
eye travels down into its depths, where the course of the river
is lost in a glowing wilderness of vegetation. The road was so
bad and unsafe that we got off our horses and walked up to the
grottoes, where a great disappointment awaited us, for they are
nothing but pent-houses, produced by the projecting rock; holes
and notches, moreover, plainly testified that we had been preceded
long since by other seekers. Broken skulls and bones, of no
interest whatever, lay scattered about. We picked up, however,
saucepan handles of every size, red earthen vases striped with
black, a much injured idol of Tlaloc, a bit of an Indian flute.
This had been, no doubt, a funeral station completely rifled.
We came away with feelings the reverse of pleasant.</p>

<p>We were not more successful in attempting a teocalli in
the heart of Amecameca, than we had been at Mispayantla;
remembering, however, that cemeteries abounded in the
mountains, I flattered myself I should find one towards
Iztaccihuatl. “Tepalcates,” potteries, I had been told, were
to be met in various places, but small had been the result on
my visiting the sites indicated. From inquiries and the
promise of a good reward, I got an Indian to act as guide
to Iztaccihuatl, which he knows well, having often been there
for the same purpose as ourselves; a few preliminaries are
soon settled, and taking some half-dozen men with me, we
set out on our mountain expedition. The ascent is performed
with great difficulty, for we are just in for the rainy season,
and the path is simply abominable. Our horses slip, rear, fall,
and we frequently risk breaking our necks; the mule, laden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">Pg 180</a></span>
with our instruments and luggage, refuses to move until he is
relieved of half his burden.</p>

<p>Leaving Amecameca, we follow a very steep path overlooking
frightful precipices, and reach the summit after a forced
march of six hours. From this point may be seen the valley,
some 3,900 feet long by 1,625 to 1,950 feet broad, bounded by
the mountain range which to the west of Mexico makes it impassable.
To the east are the peaks of Iztaccihuatl, covered
with virgin snow, 650 feet below us; on the crest the barometer
marks 12,512 feet, and 12,318 in the valley, that is as near as
possible the altitude of Tlamacas.</p>

<p>This narrow valley is so completely closed in by perpendicular
rocks, that it would be next to impossible to spy it out
without a guide; it is fringed half-way up by gloomy pines,
but above us the rock is quite bare. Stray cattle graze
peaceably at the bottom of the valley, which owes its name to
the nearest peak, “Nahualac.” The latter must have been a far
more important funeral station than Tenenepanco. Everything
favours this assumption, whilst stone foundations make it
probable that a temple or a sanctuary dedicated to Tlaloc
once stood here, similar to that mentioned by Father Duran,
of which no trace has been found by us. We descry, however,
to the north-east of the valley, an artificial pond 195 feet in
circumference; in the centre rose a monument, the foundations
of which are still extant; and round the pond are similar but
smaller monuments, pedestals, altars, or chapels, bearing the
statue of Tlaloc.</p>

<p>In a few minutes my men unearthed no fewer than forty
vases, several plates, goblets, in the same style as those found
at Tenenepanco, save that the clay is coarser and the ornamentation
more archaic. This beginning was so promising, that
notwithstanding the bitter cold at night, only half-sheltered as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">Pg 181</a></span>
we were, my dreams were golden; and the next morning, after
a hot cup of coffee mixed with a good dose of mezcal, we were
eager to set to work again, when our “finds” were if anything
more abundant, and similar to those of the previous day: idols,
cups, three-footed goblets, pottery with Tlaloc’s image; very
few jewels, however, and no precious stones, whilst the total
absence of human remains seems to indicate great antiquity for
these remains.</p>

<p>It may be well to mention that a small cup, bearing the
image of Tlaloc and placed in the centre of the Tenenepanco
Plate, belongs properly to Nahualac. It forms a pendant to
another cup also in my possession. Both are quite unique in
their way, for nothing in the Aztec antiquities recalls either the
material, the shape, the ornamentation, or the workmanship. If
this cemetery were Aztec, therefore, it must date back to the
early establishment of that tribe in the valley; but in all
probability it is either Chichemec or Toltec, for had it been
Aztec, human remains would have been found, whereas it is
well known that the Toltecs offered only birds, feathers, and
flowers to their favourite god, and this leads us to suppose that
Nahualac was one among the primeval Toltec stations.</p>

<p>Our four days’ explorations produced nearly eight hundred
pieces of all kinds. Our sanguine hopes had been more than
realised, and with jubilant feelings we bade the mountain adieu;
but alas! our treasure, like its predecessor, went to fill up the
shelves of the Mexican Museum.</p>

<p>If the ascent had been painful, the descent was even more
so. Leaving the Indians to follow with our luggage, Colonel
Castro and I went in advance; but we soon lost our way, and
rolled rather than walked down the steep, precipitous slopes of
the mountain, whilst our horses, which we were leading, came
upon us like avalanches, and often threatened our destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">Pg 182</a></span>
We reached the plain at last, and a few minutes brought us to
Ameca.</p>

<p>Our excavations on the high plateaux are over; we leave for
the warm region, to follow the Toltecs in their great migration
at the beginning of the eleventh century.</p>

Ornamental Slabs—Las Dos Bocas—Cortez—Rio Seco—Paraïso.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are once more at Vera Cruz, <i>en route</i> for Tabasco, where
we are received, as on our first arrival, with the terrible Norte,
blowing so hard that no steamer can get away; and to do something
I visit the Public Library, which, besides some interesting
works, contains also specimens of Totonac antiquities, and
a good Indian map on calico.</p>

<p>The wind changes, and we are at last able to go on board
the steamer which is to convey us to the mouth of Rio Tabasco,
sometime known as Grijalva, after the Spanish explorer; and here
we leave our large ship for the river boat. The banks of this
river are exceedingly flat and uninteresting; some king-fishers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">Pg 184</a></span>
some white and blue herons, now and then a crocodile, are the
only things which break the monotony of this dreary scene.</p>

<p>We stop at a small unhealthy village called Frontera, where
we have to change again for S. Juan. The heat is suffocating;
our berths so close that we try the tops of our cabins, but no
sooner are our mosquito curtains fixed, and ourselves, as we
fondly imagine, settled for the night, than a shower of fiery
sparks from the engine, which is fed with charcoal, sets our
clothes on fire and obliges us to make a hasty retreat, the more
so that the ship carries a large cargo of petroleum. Below, a
lively night awaits us, and when from sheer weariness we fall
asleep at last, we are rudely awakened by the cries of all the
denizens of the forest.</p>

<p>A few habitations, a few fields under cultivation, some
rare palm-trees, or a flock of sheep, warn us that we are
getting near S. Juan. But all we can see at present from
our steamer is a long line of low houses, nor is our first
impression dispelled when we walk into this outlying, forlorn-looking
town. Outward appearance, however, is proverbially
deceitful; it is particularly so here, for S. Juan is in reality
the great mart of the State, and carries on an extensive trade
in cedar, mahogany, and other fine wood. The population
is simple, obliging, civil, every house open to us; the Governor,
a right good fellow, provides us with letters for the interior,
and with men as guides and servants.</p>

<p>We have, unfortunately, just come in for the rainy season;
the roads are turned into torrents, and so completely broken
that we have to give up going to Comala by land and shall
have to go by water. This will necessitate a very long detour;
on the other hand it will give us the opportunity of visiting
the interesting remains to be found at Bellote. Thus our
misfortune will not be very great after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">Pg 185</a></span></p>

<p>This point settled, we are soon ready to start for Tierra
Colorada, a rancho some nine miles from S. Juan, on the banks
of Rio Gonzalès, where we are to find flat-bottomed <i>canoas</i> and
<i>bogas</i>, “oarsmen.” These <i>canoas</i> are hollowed out of the trunk of
a tree, have no keels, and are rowed down stream, when the
maximum speed is twelve leagues a day, and three up stream.
Close to the landing-place is a wooden booth, where before going
on board we get about the nastiest cup of coffee I ever tasted,
served with pretty grace by a handsome Meztiza. We notice
the cups, made of some fruit-shell shaped on the tree whilst
growing, and I am so pleased with their shape and design that
I buy two for my private collection.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-185.jpg" width="500" height="340" alt="CANOA (BOAT) OF S. JUAN." />
<p class="caption">CANOA (BOAT) OF S. JUAN.</p></div>

<p>Our <i>canoas</i>, which are of average size, do not allow two to
sit abreast; the awning, <i>toldo</i>, which is to shelter us both against
sun and rain, is so low that we have to crawl in on all-fours and
sit Turkish fashion. This in a few hours becomes very painful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">Pg 186</a></span>
and our position is greatly aggravated by mosquitoes. There
is not a breath of wind, so that our progress is but slow, whilst
the heat under cover is intolerable; but whenever I venture out
I am forced back either by the scorching sun or pouring rain,
and we must needs comfort ourselves as best we can with some
excellent Tabasco cigars. We lose nothing, for this region is
but an assemblage of savannas and stunted woods, which lie for
months under water.</p>

<p>We soon arrive at <i>Ceiba</i>, a rancho, where we land to breakfast
under a wide-spreading tree by the river, depositing under its
cool shade our provisions and our cramped, aching limbs. Here
we are detained longer than we anticipated by our men, who,
after refreshing themselves at the rancho, coolly walked some
three miles further on to see their sweethearts. They hurry in
at last looking rather sheepish, and we find on consulting our
map that our next station is twelve miles distant, and that we
shall not reach it till late in the evening. The heat abates as
the dusk gathers in, when we are glad to leave our hateful <i>toldo</i>
to breathe the freshening breeze.</p>

<p>We are now advancing amidst the islands which occupy the
mouth of the river, clad with gigantic mangroves; all around
is silent, and the moon, placid but not cold in these latitudes,
sheds her magic light over the landscape, shaping out fantastic
groves, fairy castles, and long lines of porticoes in the openings
of the forest. We are so delighted with all we see that we
are quite surprised, after a run of sixteen hours, to find ourselves
at the rancho of Las Islas, where we spend what remains of the
night, and early the next morning start for Paraïso.</p>

<p>Up to this time we have been going steadily north, but
now our route bears to the west. We enter the lagoons to
be found on this coast, intersected by narrow canals, and overshadowed
by deep, gloomy paths. The murky water of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">Pg 187</a></span>
canals, the silence of the forest, recall the Styx, or some forgotten
circle of Purgatory in which the dead wander in endless
solitudes. Beautiful large butterflies, speckled with black and
blue, come fluttering by, whilst a multitude of red hairy crabs
glare at us out of some mangrove. Two hours’ steady rowing
brings us to Bellote Islands, when, stowing our boats on the sand,
we hail the first man we see, and under his escort make for the
<i>cuyos</i>, pyramids, walking by the shore of the island, the water
of which is so transparent as to enable us to spy at the bottom
of the lagoon a quantity of oyster-shells; presently we come
upon a gigantic bank of them measuring several miles, by more
than twelve feet high, <i>kjœkkenmœdings</i>; the whole ground around
is composed of these broken shells, over which a magnificent
vegetation luxuriates.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-187.jpg" width="500" height="338" alt="RANCHO AT BELLOTE." />
<p class="caption">RANCHO AT BELLOTE.</p></div>

<p>The pyramids, which are the object of our visit, are three
in number, from 195 to 325 feet at the base, by 37 to 43 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">Pg 188</a></span>
height. The temples which once stood on the summit are but
a mass of ruins. Thanks to excavations made by the owner of
the rancho, one side of one of the pyramids has been cleared
of the vegetation and now a good view can be obtained, enabling
us to perceive that it is identical in all respects with those at
Tula and Teotihuacan, save that this is much smaller, the baby
pattern, so to speak, of those we have hitherto visited. On the
terrace crowning the pyramid a fragment of wall on an incline
is still standing, covered with hard cement. This facing was
composed of four layers of lime and mortar, each coating
representing figures and characters in bas-reliefs, modelled in
the lime coating. On removing one of these the next was
discovered, almost invariably at the cost of nearly the whole
bas-relief. We were fortunate in taking away intact the
fragment shown in our plate, a head with retreating forehead
resting on the instep of a foot which lies on a cushion. The
notable feature of this profile is its similarity with those on the
bassi-rilievi at Palenque, proving in my opinion the unity of
civilisation of the two countries, save that priority of date must
be awarded to Bellote. Besides these reliefs we found a vast
quantity of broken arms, hands, ex-votos, pottery, etc.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that these pyramids, unlike those at
Teotihuacan, were built with shells and mud, and that baked
bricks were only employed in the partition walls and those of the
temples. That such materials should have been used was natural
in a region where even gravel is unknown.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Toltec chronology, it was observed that
on the new fire being rekindled, all house furniture was renewed,
every dwelling and every temple repainted. Is it beyond the
bounds of possibility to imagine that this custom received here
its highest development, that the walls of the temples were
covered with hieroglyphic coatings commemorating the age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">Pg 189</a></span>
which had just elapsed, and that each succeeding century
received a layer similarly inscribed? Were this presumption
substantiated, a starting-point would be obtained, enabling us to
state that at the Conquest in 1520, this monument was four
Indian centuries, or 208 years old, plus the fraction of the
century just begun. I am well aware that this hypothesis is
not borne out by scientific facts, and that I cannot even claim
<span class="figright200" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus-189.jpg" width="200" height="335" alt="TEMPLE BAS-RELIEF, BELLOTE." />
<span class="caption">TEMPLE BAS-RELIEF, BELLOTE.</span></span>
the honour of being the first in
starting it, for I was forestalled
by Stephens, who says: “In the
remotest corridor of the palace,
the wall was coated with lime, and
broken in various places; I counted
as many as six coatings, every one
of which bore traces of paintings.
In a corner were characters which
looked as though they had been
written with black ink. In our
efforts to reach this, the whole
thing came down and obliged us
to desist.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>Granting our theory, the six
layers at Palenque would be equivalent
to 312 years, plus the fraction of the current century,
which might bring it to 330 years at the Conquest, and about
690 years old up to the present time, an antiquity which may be
reasonably accorded to Palenque, as the sequel will show.</p>

<p>As may have been noticed, these monuments are identical
with those observed by the early Spaniards, and so often
described by their historians; and if it is borne in mind that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">Pg 190</a></span>when the Toltecs were driven from the high plateaux they
migrated south, and were found as early as 1124 established
at Goatzacoalco, Tabasco, and Yucatan, by the envoys of Xolotl,
the conclusion that the monuments under notice belong to this
tribe must force itself upon every unbiassed mind.</p>

<p>We leave Bellote <i>en route</i> for Paraïso, following the course of
Tomo, Largo, and calling at Ceiba, a small hamlet standing amidst
a glorious landscape. Here once rose Cintla, a dependency of
Tabasco, and this is the river which Grijalva discovered, which
Cortez navigated, and on the banks of which he fought his great
battle, against 40,000 or 50,000 Indians. Many are the proofs
which can be brought to confirm our opinion: this river has
but one mouth, and therefore can at no time have borne the
name of <i>Las Dos Bocas</i>; we read that Cortez was obliged to
use launches on account of its shallow waters, whereas vessels
of great tonnage, drawing twelve feet of water, ply daily on
it; the tide, moreover, advances farther in at Frontera than is
reported by Diaz.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> Herrera says that Cortez, whilst in this
region, took up his position on an islet opposite the village:
now there is but one very large island, and that nearly a mile
below Frontera; that his soldiers crossed the river to reconnoitre,
but the stream is so wide and so deep at that point, as to
preclude the possibility of any fording-place; that the general
traversed immense cocoa-plantations, yet none are to be seen
about Frontera, whereas on Rio Seco, over which we float
at this present moment, it is the principal cultivation. Herrera’s
account consequently is applicable in every respect to Rio Seco,
with its two mouths, its impassable bar, and its fording-places;
here was fought the great battle, not far rose the Indian
capital, the name of which has not come down to us, but which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">Pg 191</a></span>is known as Comalcalco at the present day; and we are of opinion
that Ceiba, or Zeiba, is the village where Cortez, in the name
of the king, took possession of the country.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>Cogolludo, in speaking of the first skirmishes of the Spaniards
against the cacique of Tabasco, says: “They numbered over
12,000 entrenched behind some breastworks, but we made a
sudden rush, forced them out of their defences, obliging them
to fall back; this they did like good soldiers without turning
their backs, raining showers of arrows on us, until they reached
the outward buildings of some temples, from which they took
all they could carry. The enemy being now in full retreat,
Cortez stopped all further pursuit, and here, in the name of
His Majesty, he took possession of the country, drawing his
sword and making three large cuts at a huge tree, which is
called <i>Ceiba</i> by the natives, and which grew on the terrace
of the temple, exclaiming that should any one question his
right, he was ready to make it good with his sword and
shield.”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>It may be objected that this quotation proves nothing at all,
that ceibas grow everywhere, and that the taking of possession
could be easily effected on any spot of the Mexican soil. Just so;
yet a remarkable coincidence is this, that no ceibas grow about
the village of that name, that the one cut by Cortez, owing to the
rapid growth of such trees, must long since have disappeared, and
that on my inquiring for “Ceiba” at the village supposed to be it,
no one seemed to know.</p>

<p>It is a well-ascertained fact that an appellation given in honour
of a great event to a certain spot lives on when the object which
gave rise to it has perished. Is it so unreasonable to suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">Pg 192</a></span>that the Spaniards who settled later at Ceiba, a spot consecrated
by the taking of possession, on identifying Cortez’ tree, should
name the village they erected after it? If I make a running
comment on history, if I discover points of analogy at every step,
I do so whilst visiting carefully the very places under notice,
bearing in mind historical accounts. These details are of vital
importance in affirming the existence of Comalcalco at the time of
the Conquest, as also that Rio Seco was then a large river whose
course was turned by the Spaniards to ruin the Indian city, which
rose on its banks.</p>

<p>Of the beauty of the country between Ceiba and Paraïso
no words of expression, no painter’s brush could give an adequate
idea: noble avenues of cocoa and palm-trees open out at almost
every stroke of the oar; lovely plants of tender green, with light
yellow clustering flowers, float down the rapid stream, forming
fairy-like rafts which remind us of the Mexican chinampas. My
admiration for this lovely scene around me, finds no echo among
my travelling companions, who are either sleeping or differently
engrossed. The longer I observe the high banks, the bed both
wide and deep of this stream, now reduced to a torrent, the more
firmly am I convinced that it was at some time a great river,
whose course whether nature or man have altered within a
comparatively recent period, and tradition here becomes historical
truth.</p>

<p>We reach Paraïso at last; the name had prepared us for
something better than the wretched hamlet where we land. It
was destroyed, it seems, in a local affray, as the ruins, the
fallen trunks of large trees sufficiently attest. Outward appearance
is no sure index to gauge Paraïso or its “descalzado”
inhabitants, who are in reality well-to-do. The good man
who kindly offered to escort us about, is, for this country, quite
wealthy; nor is he a solitary instance of friendliness, it seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">Pg 193</a></span>
to pervade the whole community. The place has no hotel or
inn of any kind, but a house is easily got to serve our purpose, as
much food as we want is forced upon us by these good-natured
people; and if it is not quite English hospitality, it is very near it.
The Paraïsians are perfectly satisfied with their condition in
life; their wishes are few, and such as the fertility of the soil
will easily meet; want is unknown, life easy, the climate
admits of but the scantiest clothing, and if they have more
than their share of rain, they are troubled with fewer mosquitoes
than most of their neighbours. In fact, these charming people are
fully convinced that all is for the best in this best of worlds,
and that if Paraïso is not heaven itself, it is not far from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> road from Paraïso to Comalcalco is no road at all, a veritable
“Slough of Despond,” in which our horses sink to the hocks,
sometimes to the girths, but as the natives see nothing to find
fault in it, there is little hope of improvement. The road follows
the course of Rio Seco, ancient Tabasco to our right, and three
hours’ march brings us to Comalcalco, a little modern town
situated on an island of the river, some ninety miles north-west
of S. Juan Bautista, and twenty-four, as a bird flies, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">Pg 195</a></span>
seaboard. The place, including the outskirts, numbers some two
thousand inhabitants; the streets are straight, the houses low
and built with bricks. The banks of the lagoons are clad with
thick long grass, in which naked urchins and ducks innumerable
seem to luxuriate all day long, alternating with plunges into the
water, puffing at cigars nearly as big as themselves. Comalcalco
is the very Elysium of life for both ducks and urchins.</p>

<p>Our “fonda” is not exactly luxurious, but the civility of the
people, and the excellent cooking of our hostess, a handsome
woman of five-and-twenty, combine to make life bearable. True,
our beds are not water-proof, for the water gets in every time it
rains, whilst the quacking of the ducks awakes us twenty times
of a night; but as this seems to be the normal state of things, as
nobody appears to mind, it behoves us not to be over fastidious
in a country in which things are taken mighty easy. Salt,
owing to the excessively damp climate, is liquid, and served
in bottles. The terrible Norte is nearly as much felt here
as in Vera Cruz; it brings invariably persistent rain, waterspouts,
<i>trebunadas</i>, and frightful squalls. My camera has
created a <i>furore</i> in this out-of-the-way place, and we are
besieged all day with people wanting their portraits taken, to
the delight of our “tendero”; meanwhile valuable time is
spent in explanations and refusals before we can rid ourselves
of these simple, troublesome people. No sooner, however, did
our mission become known, than everybody was eager to come as
guides, and workmen were obtained with the greatest facility.</p>

<p>The local doctor speaks enthusiastically of the ruins lying
some six miles north-east of this place, and about a mile and
a half from the river. Masks, pottery, idols of the description
found at Teotihuacan, have been brought to light; but what
was deemed far more important by the natives, an inexhaustible
mine of baked bricks of every size, with which the houses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">Pg 196</a></span>
the village have been built, and the main walk paved. When
these excavations first began, statues, stones of sacrifice (indicative
of later times), columns, huge flags, and cement were unearthed.
Unfortunately the whole was destroyed by these ignorant people.</p>

<p>The ruins consist in groups of pyramids of different dimensions,
so extensive as to cover twenty-four miles, and on this
account are called the “Cordillera” by the natives. A country
gentleman tells me that he has counted over three hundred of
these artificial mounds on his own property, and that they were
built with mud and baked bricks.</p>

<p>Besides these ruins others are to be met at Blasillo, situated
on the Toltec march of migration, answering the description
given by Bernal Diaz regarding Tonala. I hear from a montanero,
who first discovered them, that an important Indian city
formerly existed there, whose monuments, like those of Comalcalco,
consist of caryatides, columns, and statues; but in this
abominable weather it is utterly impossible to visit them. This
city having the same origin, the same environment with Comalcalco,
must have the same origin; and Toltec migration, Toltec civilising
influence being admitted as well as proved, these two cities would
be among the first built by them after their great migration, for
the simple reason that they stand nearest their point of departure,
as the most distant would mark their later settlements; and this
our investigations will amply demonstrate.</p>

<p>We set out for the ruins, following for a time the right bank
of the Rio Seco; then a path across fields, bordered with large
yellow and red flowers. We notice to our right and left thick
layers of cement, the remains of the old Indian road which
connected the city with the river. We cross rivulets formerly
spanned by bridges, of which bricks and a corbel vault are still
visible.</p>

<p>On reaching the pyramid, we leave our horses and ascend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">Pg 197</a></span>
with some difficulty the terrace surmounting it; we wander about
in semi-darkness because of the rank vegetation which mantles
over it. Our men clear it of the most obstructive trees, to
facilitate its measurement: the shape of this pyramid is irregular,
being 975 feet at the base, by some ninety-nine feet in height.
Our plan gives the various monuments standing on its vast
summit, measuring no less than 292 feet.</p>

<p class="caption">BAYS OF RUINED PALACE, COMALCALCO.</p></div>

<p>The principal monument (No. 3) was a great palace, the
façade of which looked east and covered 231 feet, now reduced
to a ruinous mass; fortunately a fragment of some twenty-two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">Pg 198</a></span>
feet (No. 4) enables us to reconstruct the edifice. Our first
drawing is a view of the outside, showing the dilapidated condition
of the wall and its brick and mortar composition; the next
a view of the interior, with fragments of thinner walls which
divided the various apartments of the palace, probably seven or
eight in number, of different dimensions, and having the same
characteristics as the monuments at Uxmal and Palenque. It
is the governor’s palace with its double bay of rooms, the slightly
concave vault of Palenque; and if in our section of the palace a
greater obliquity is observable, in the frieze supporting the roof,
than in edifices of the same kind already known, or to be studied
subsequently, this sloping finds here its proper place, and proves
the intelligence of the builder without destroying the similarity of
the different monuments. In fact, we shall see the roof assuming
a steeper or less steep incline, according to the climate; slightly
oblique at Palenque where rain is frequent, it rises in the Yucatan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">Pg 199</a></span>
peninsula, where a dry climate prevails, until it forms a flat roof,
resting on perpendicular walls; whereas at Comalcalco and on the
borders of the Gulf, where rain is incessant, architects increase
the slope of the roof to facilitate the out-flow of the water, the
better to preserve their buildings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<p class="caption">SECTION OF RUINS AT COMALCALCO.</p></div>

<p>If baked bricks mixed with thick layers of lime and mortar
were substituted for stones, it is because none are to be found
in that alluvial plain. As to the blocks necessary for the construction
of columns, statues, altars, etc., they were brought by
river from the mountains. But these modifications never destroy
the typical outline of the Toltec calli, to be found in the chapter
on Tula, and all the monuments which we shall meet with in
our explorations will have the same type and the same
architecture.</p>

<p>But to return. The walls of the palace were without any
ornamentation, save a layer of smooth painted cement; they
rose perpendicularly nine feet to a very projecting cornice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">Pg 200</a></span>
then sloping in a line parallel to the corbel vault, they terminated
in a second cornice less salient than the first, both serving as
frame to a frieze richly decorated, so far at least as could be
ascertained from the fragments strewing the ground. Above
this, towards the centre of the roof, rose a decorated wall, a
peculiarly Toltec device, which existed already in the temples
of the high plateaux, and which we shall observe in most
structures, whether temples or palaces, terra-cotta models of which
are to be found in the Trocadéro.</p>

<p>The building, including the walls, measures some 26 feet,
the walls are 3 feet 9 inches in thickness, the size of the
apartments is about 8 feet, and the depth of the vault inside
some 23 feet (see Plate). The palace was brightly painted, as
may yet be seen in the north corner, which is of a deep red.
The miscellaneous compound to be met at Tula and Teotihuacan
is not observable here, where obsidian came from a great distance
and was accordingly rare; pottery was consequently replaced by
fruit-shells, which had the advantage of being more durable,
cheaper, and lighter. These shells are worked into a variety
of shapes differing in size and value: there are the <i>jicaras</i>,
small cups, pure and simple; <i>tecomates</i>, large cups; <i>atotoniles</i>,
<i>cubiletes</i>, <i>cocos</i>, etc.; then the <i>jicara-flor</i>, or half-shell cut crosswise;
the most prized of all, the <i>jicara-boton</i>, half upper shell;
the <i>jicara-barba</i>, or shell cut lengthwise. All these shells are
given elegant shapes whilst growing on the tree, and when dry
are ornamented with pretty devices either sunk or in relief. A
calabash having a very large shell is also fashioned into a vase
called <i>atecomate</i> by the Indians, and painted with fast colours of
which the natives alone seem to have the secret.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-201.jpg" width="500" height="359" alt="RUINS OF PALACE." />
<p class="caption">RUINS OF PALACE.</p></div>

<p>But if few fragments were found in comparison with those
unearthed on the high plateaux, I had the good fortune to pick
up two bricks covered with curious sunk designs, most rare, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">Pg 201</a><br /><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">Pg 202</a><br /><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">Pg 203</a></span>they were the only two specimens I could find of the kind. A
concentric drawing covers the first, whilst the second bears the
full likeness of a warrior, with feathers about his head—it is a
rude drawing which was done on the soft clay before it was
baked. Both bricks are in the Trocadéro.</p>

<p>Some 35 feet to the south-east of the palace, on a cemented
platform over 26 feet broad by 38 feet long, is a tower (No. 1
in our plan) which is supported and bound by the roots of large
trees surrounding it. It is oblong in shape, most picturesque,
and, save the base, similar to that at Palenque. This tower has
three storeys, of which two are still standing, and it may be
assumed from what remains that the second storey was divided
into four compartments or small rooms, the dimensions of which
are the following: two inner rooms, of 5 feet 7 inches on one
side, correspond to other two, and form a kind of outward passage,
having three openings, which are separated by two pillars of
2 feet on one side. The first storey underneath reproduced
probably the same distribution. We penetrated in the only
accessible room, measuring some 8 feet by 5 feet 8 inches.</p>

<p>The ornamentation of this tower must have been gigantic;
the fragment which was found among a heap of rubbish, and
which we reproduce, is no less than 6 feet. The figures or
characters seen on the wall, and which recall Arabic inscriptions,
are over 3 feet high, and in strong relief. This was obtained
by applications of freshly-made plaster—a process belonging to
the first epoch, and which we shall meet at Palenque, Tikal,
and particularly Aké and Izamal in the Yucatan peninsula.</p>

<p>Tower No. 2, some 32 feet to the south-east of the palace,
is a ruinous mass, but must have been far more important
than the first. Nothing remains save fragments of walls, so
shapeless as to make it difficult to draw an approximate plan
of the building. To the north, however, a flight of steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">Pg 204</a></span>
in fair preservation allows us to reconstruct the first storey. The
four sides were probably similar, having doors opening on the
stairs by which the terrace was reached, giving access to four
rooms, now underground, of about 8 feet by 6 feet 8 inches. Our
drawing gives the stairs and the entrance to one of the rooms.
In this tower the ornamentation must have been as peculiar as that
of No. 1, as shown by an enormous unbroken fragment of wall
lying on the ground, representing the full-size figure of a man,
whose fine proportions are very remarkable. The upper portion
of the body, the fore-arm, and part of the leg are wanting; of
the clothing nothing remains save the girdle and a bit on the
thigh. The statue had presumably no other covering but the
maxtli, as is the case at Palenque in the decoration of the inner
wing of the palace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-204.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="ORNAMENTATION OF SOUTH-EAST TOWER, COMALCALCO." />
<p class="caption">ORNAMENTATION OF SOUTH-EAST TOWER, COMALCALCO.</p></div>

<p>This tower (No. 2), with its flight of steps and its platform
on which rose the body of the edifice, answers the description
of similar monuments at Cozumel and along the seaboard given
by Oviedo and Grijalva’s chaplain; and both towers and palaces,
as also the temples we shall visit later, must have gleamed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">Pg 205</a></span>
the astonished gaze of the Spaniards, as did those of the maritime
cities in Yucatan. We know that the first were inhabited at the
time of the Conquest; have we not the right to affirm as much
for Comalcalco? And if Comalcalco was inhabited, what shall
be said of Palenque, where we shall find a far greater number
of buildings in better preservation?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-205.jpg" width="400" height="487" alt="REMAINS OF TOWER NO. 2, AND ENTRANCE OF SUBTERRANEOUS HALL." />
<p class="caption">REMAINS OF TOWER NO. 2, AND ENTRANCE OF SUBTERRANEOUS HALL.</p></div>

<p>It seems to us a settled question. Why should monuments
constructed in the same way, in the same country, amidst the
same vegetation, be in ruins when others are partly standing?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">Pg 206</a></span>
Does this prove that they are of more recent date? The same
causes acted on all. Everything points to their similarity, to
their belonging to the same epoch, to their being the work of
the same hand; and if the palaces and temples at Comalcalco
were extant and inhabited at the Conquest (and everything seems
to prove it), the temples and palaces at Palenque must have
been in the same condition.</p>

<p>But the palace and the two towers were not the only monuments
on the terrace of the pyramid. No. 5 and No. 6 indicate
the site of other buildings now completely ruined, whilst the
sides were occupied by small chapels, traces of which are still
discernible. The pyramid was in itself a small village, or rather
an immense lordly mansion, having a palace, temples, houses,
and huts for priests and servants. Facing this pyramid, to the
north, hidden by the luxuriant vegetation of a virgin forest (reproduced
in our drawing), are three other pyramids, of which
two rise to the height of some 22 to 26 feet, and the third from
39 to 45 feet. All were crowned by temples, the walls of which
are still standing. The layers of demolished cement leave uncovered
the body of the wall, in which I notice bricks ranging
from 6 in. by 9 by 1 in thickness, and from about 1 ft. 4 in. by 11
by 1 in. thick, and 1 ft. 11 in. by 1 ft. 8 in. by 1 ft. 2 in. thick.
The largest were used for the corners. Hundreds of other
pyramids, every one occupied by palaces, stretch as far as the
seaboard, buried in the depths of the forest, presenting innumerable
monuments to be brought to light, for which years, numerous
workmen, an iron constitution, are required for the future
explorers. I have shown the way—let others follow.</p>

<p>The stupendous ruins, of which we have had but a glimpse,
imply an immense amount of labour, and, as a corollary, a dense
population. It is quite clear that the present Tabasco, with a
population of 100,000 inhabitants, could not produce monuments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">Pg 207</a></span>
so imposing as those at Comalcalco, and this is one of the chief
objections brought against the recent date we ascribe to these
buildings. But then the question arises, who built them ages
before the Conquest, and what became of the numerous population
which such monuments presuppose? The genius of the Toltecs
which we have studied, the quotations of various authors relating
to their southward migration, point to them as the sole and true
creators of these buildings which we have even now visited, as
also those we shall subsequently explore. They found—facts attest
it—a numerous population, which they civilised, and which under
their peaceful organisation rapidly increased. They had, at the
very outset of their establishment, the cheapest, easiest labour
ever known in these hardy, sober, submissive people, who, as
we noticed before, could live on two tortillas a day, drink nothing
but water, carry enormous loads, or work all day without showing
fatigue.</p>

<p>If, then, due regard be had to their numbers, their endurance,
and their frugal habits, if it be remembered that New Mexico
was built in no time by Cortez, the whole city of Tula reconstructed
in six years, most likely by statute-labour when great
multitudes were pressed into service, directed by foremen who
gave the final polishing touch to the work, the number and
the bulk of the monuments they have left will not surprise.
That such work could be achieved in a very short time is shown
at Teotihuacan, where the pyramids are but an assemblage of
mud and rude stones kept together by walls faced with coatings
of polished cement.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is an accepted fact that a high state of
civilisation can only be developed in temperate regions; in
torrid zones the heat, an almost spontaneous growth, the few
wants of man, keep him idle and unfit him for work, and this
consideration would, in the absence of any other proof, still point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">Pg 208</a></span>
to the Toltecs as the authors of the degree of civilisation
observable in these regions. As an instance of the truth of
our argument look at India, where a foreign race introduced
and implanted a ready-made civilisation in the invaded country,
using the conquered race for the construction of its buildings.
This theory receives still greater weight when we remember
how easily a people which has received its civilisation through
another, falls back into its original state of barbarism as soon
as left to itself; India, Cambodia, Java, are striking examples.</p>

<p>But it will be asked, What has become of the dense population
you speak about? Where are the millions of men who peopled
these regions at the time of the Conquest? The causes which
contributed to their disappearance are not far to seek. First and
foremost, the Spanish invasion and the consequent destruction of
the Mexican empire, which so deeply disturbed the organisation
of all these peoples as to be felt in the most distant provinces;
it was a commotion followed by a profound discouragement and
apathy, which told directly and radically on the fecundity of the
race. Add to this the intense horror felt for the conquerors—a
horror so complete as to cause the natives to abandon the places
occupied by the hated foreigners—a stupor so great as to have
persisted to the present day. Even now Indian villages are
abandoned at the appearance of a Spaniard, and again occupied
when he leaves, as was the case at Tayasal when taken
by the Spanish general Martin Ursua. So much for moral
causes.</p>

<p>As to physical causes, historians will tell us they were due to
the unheard-of cruelty of the Spaniards—a cruelty all the more
inconceivable that Mendieta ascribes to the natives a mild, simple,
submissive, patient disposition, in fact all the Christian virtues
so conspicuously absent from their hard taskmasters, who were
guilty towards the poor Indians of daily savage acts which dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">Pg 209</a></span>honour
humanity, tearing them from their families and sending
them to work the mines in the distant mountains, etc.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>Then there were epidemics which swept away vast numbers
of Indians: 1st, small-pox in 1521, called by the natives <i>huey-zahuatl</i>,
“great leprosy”—half the population succumbed under
it; 2nd, measles (<i>sarampion</i>), in 1531, <i>tepiton-zahuatl</i>, small
leprosy; 3rd, syphilis; 4th, bloody-flux in 1545, when in Tlascala
and Tula 250,000 Indians perished; lastly, the various epidemics
of 1564, 1576, 1588, 1595, which carried off over 3,000,000
natives. The same epidemics were felt <i>with greater severity</i> in
Tabasco and Yucatan.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Herrera gives likewise measles, smallpox,
bloody-flux, fever, dysentery, as the main causes of the
disappearance of the aborigines;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> as does Motolinia, who
mentions besides the great famine consequent on the taking of
Mexico; “encomiendas,” and especially the heavy fiscal burdens
imposed on the poor Indians by the Spaniards, burdens which
had to be paid under penalty of being tortured to death.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> Other
authorities might be adduced to show that the disappearance of
the Indians, if unnatural, is to be explained, it being clear that
the great cities, so thickly populated on the arrival of the
Spaniards, were almost entirely abandoned, whilst the temples
and palaces, left to the mercy of the elements and the ruthless
efforts of man, were quickly destroyed. If we could wonder,
it is that under such circumstances they resisted so long.</p>

<p>As structures, American monuments cannot be compared with
those at Cambodia, which belong to nearly the same period, the
twelfth century, and which, notwithstanding their greater and more
resisting proportions, are found in the same dilapidated condition</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">Pg 210</a></span></p>

<p>But we must think of returning to S. Juan; we take leave
of our Comalcalcan friends, leaving our “bogas,” boatmen, to follow
with our traps by water, and meet us at S. Juan, whilst we start
on horseback by a shorter route, skirting Rio Seco on our right,
with its islands clad with a glowing vegetation. On the opposite
side fields of yellow maize, sugar, coffee, and cocoa, indicate
the presence of ranchos and haciendas. We get glimpses of
the red, yellow, and green madrina-berries peeping out of
glistening foliage, and towards four o’clock we knock at a
large hacienda, the property of Don Candido Verao, an amateur
antiquarian, glad of an opportunity of showing his little collection.
From him we learn that tumuli or basements of Indian chapels
abound in the neighbourhood, and that many small figures
are found, showing the country to have once been densely
populated. Here we spend a charming evening, and on the
morrow we start for El Carmen, on the left bank of the river
Tabasco, belonging to a rich mahogany contractor, by name
Don Policarpio Valenzuela. Thanks to his civility, we were
able to procure canoes and be at S. Juan Bautista the next
day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> land route from S. Juan to Palenque is some thirty or
thirty-five leagues; but we were obliged to go by water, which
takes about a week, on account of our heavy luggage, consisting
of seventy packages! Seventy packages may seem disproportionately
large; but it should be recollected that we had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">Pg 212</a></span>
take impressions, photographs, plans, and last, not least, provide
for two months’ living amidst ruins. A small steamer was
secured, which was to convey us as far as Jonuta, where we
should leave it for canoes.</p>

<p>Jonuta was once a populous centre, as the pyramids which
occupy part of the village site amply testify. Here antiquities
of all kinds have been unearthed, and an enthusiastic archæologist,
Mr. Nattes, possesses a fine collection, which he was kind enough
to show me. In it I found many objects very like, sometimes
identical with, those on the plateaux. Mr. Nattes is of opinion
that the Toltecs occupied the country throughout, and that all
the monuments we see were left by them. I need not say
that I am delighted to find my theory shared by so distinguished
a person.</p>

<p>On the 20th December we at last take possession of our
canoes. We row up the Usumacinta, and the next evening are
at Potrerillo—a miserable rancho, where the only accommodation
is a low, filthy hut, our evening meal a monkey—rather a pleasant
change after our salt provisions.</p>

<p>After Potrerillo we scud for some hours along El Chico;
then by canal, “rumpido,” as far as Catasaja, leaving on our
right S. Carlos lagoons, inhabited by Indians who live partly
on crocodiles and alligators—a diet which seems to agree
with them, for they are accounted the hardiest men in the
State.</p>

<p>I had visited these parts in my first expedition, when I
noticed live tailless crocodiles in most huts I went into, lying
on their backs, their claws and jaws nailed to the ground.</p>

<p>“The tail is cut off,” said mine host, “lest in moving it they
should break the legs of the person near.”</p>

<p>“But how do you capture these horrible creatures?”</p>

<p>“In two ways: with a stout hook, or with the hand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">Pg 213</a></span></p>

<p>“Here,” I said, “is a piastra for the man who will procure me
such a sight.”</p>

<p>Mine host looked round, called to a young Indian who was
outside, and informed him of my wish.</p>

<p>“All right, Señor, nothing easier; come in a boat to the
stream on the other side of the village.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes we were at the place of rendezvous, where
we found the Indian ready awaiting us, a dagger in his hand,
cautioning us to follow without making a noise, as he walked
along the high grass which grew on the banks. Suddenly two
alligators plunged into the water, and Cyrilo was after them
almost at the same time.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, which seemed hours, we spied the tail
of the monster violently beating the surface of the water, then
the whole body emerged with Cyrilo adhering to the alligator’s
belly, then both disappeared again, leaving behind a long bloody
streak.</p>

<p>“Well done, Cyrilo, well done!” cried Don Juan.</p>

<p>Yet all that could be seen was the commotion of the water
where the struggle was going on; a few minutes more and Cyrilo
came up, this time alone, breathing hard, covered with mud, and
swimming towards us. I stretched out my hand to help him in,
but he leaped into the boat without assistance and sat down quite
still for one minute.</p>

<p>“<i>Este can me cortò el dedo</i>—this dog broke my finger,” he said,
holding up his hand, of which the first joint of the forefinger was
hanging down. “<i>Però me lo pagò</i>—but I paid him out, and I
reckon we’ll soon see his ugly mug. But if not I’ll be after him
again.”</p>

<p>Don Juan winked at me. The man was preparing to plunge
once more into the murky water when Don Juan exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There he is belly upmost, his breast seamed by four thrusts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">Pg 214</a></span></p>

<p>We secured and towed him to the village. He measured
14 feet 4 inches. I gave the man two piastras instead of one,
and twenty francs for his dagger, in commemoration of his feat.</p>

<p>But to return. We plough along the swollen canal, we lose
our way, and in a short time find ourselves among shrubs and
towering trees; with some difficulty we get back to the lagoon
and reach Las Playas de Catasaja late in the evening, when we
take possession of an empty house in which to dispose of our
party and our numerous packages.</p>

<p>Our next destination is S. Domingo, eight miles distant, but no
carriers to convey our luggage are to be found for love or money;
our plight might have been awkward had not the mayor offered to
send to Palenque to procure as many men as can be had. Meanwhile,
we find enough to engage our attention in the place. Don
Rodriguez, a Government Inspector of Mines, has lately had the
central stone cross which stood in the temple bearing the same
name at Palenque, brought here. This tablet, now so well known,
has had a chequered existence.</p>

<p>Some thirty years ago, it was taken from its place, and left
lying in a forest adjoining the town by the thief, who was unable
to carry it further. It was unbroken in 1858, when I found
it covered with moss, and took a rather good photograph.
A squeeze of the entire monument, composed of three pieces,
is to be seen in the Trocadéro. Curiously enough, these
pieces are scattered in different countries: one is still <i>in situ</i>,
the second at Las Playas, whilst the third is in the Smithsonian
Institute at Washington. We give a drawing of this interesting
cross, crowned by a symbolic bird, to which a man standing
presents an offering. Since the cross was a symbol of Tlaloc,
the temple in which it stood must have been dedicated to
him, and perhaps Quetzalcoatl also, and it is clear that it
was of the same origin as the sepulchral cross at Teotihuacan;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">Pg 215</a></span>
but contrary to some writers, who make the latter proceed
from the former, we make the first proceed from the second,
for in everything we must go from the simple to the complex,
and the primitive style, the simplicity, the archaic aspect of
the cross at Teotihuacan, make it an ascendant and not a
descendant of the imaged cross at Palenque, covered with
ornamentation denoting an advanced period.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the men from Palenque have arrived, and our
freight is transported in three days to S. Domingo, whither
we follow by the last train. After Las Playas, the landscape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">Pg 216</a></span>
opens out into a noble perspective of fields and shady groves;
now the eye wanders over the rich flora of the savanna, now
it plunges into the unfathomable depths of the forest, through
which the road is a succession of triumphal arches, sometimes
so closed in as to seem impassable from a short distance. We
start hares and peccaries innumerable; we hear the shrill cries
of aras, mingled with the howling of <i>zaraguatos</i>, gravely regarding
us from their leafy bowers, whilst on the outskirts of
the wood, a timid deer gives an astonished look as we approach,
ere he betakes himself to green and deeper retreats. To crown
the enjoyment of this charming ride, we found a plentiful
luncheon awaiting us at the Pulente rancho; bananas and
oranges, which we plucked ourselves from the trees, composed
our dessert.</p>

<p>The evening found us at S. Domingo, where we took up our
quarters with one of two European families settled here. Again
the delay caused by the carriers gave us time to take an impression
of two slabs, which were formerly inlaid in the pillars
supporting the altar in the Temple of the Cross No. 1. In 1840
Stephens found them in the house of two elderly spinsters, who
refused to part with them; but after their death the Municipality
declared them public property, and had them put up in the
church façade, where they are now to be seen; one of them,
however, is broken into three pieces. Their dimensions are 6 feet
by about 3 feet. The left slab represents a young man magnificently
arrayed; he wears a richly-embroidered cape, a collar
and medallion round his neck, a beautiful girdle to his waist; the
ends of the maxtli are hanging down front and back, cothurni
cover his feet and legs up to the knee. On the upper end of
his head-dress is the head of a stork, having a fish in his bill,
whilst others are ranged below it.</p>

young man another personification of the god of rain, of
spring, of verdure and water, symbolised by the fishes and the
stork’s head, attributes which are found also on the basement of
the Tlaloc of Tacubaya. The other slab represents an old man,
clothed in a tiger’s skin, blowing out air, with a serpent round
his waist, whose tail curls up behind and coils in front, the well-ascertained
attributes of Quetzalcoatl, god of wisdom. Tlaloc and
Quetzalcoatl are often seen side by side; and we shall meet them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">Pg 218</a></span>
in the Temple of the Cross, when we shall be in a position to
advance with some show of truth that the same was dedicated
to both deities.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>After much disagreeable and unavoidable delay, we found
ourselves at Palenque, some six and a half miles east of S.
Domingo; we start immediately for the ruins, which are made
accessible by a path through the woods opened by Don
Rodriguez. El Rio Michol, to the north, seems the limit of the
ancient city on that side; to the right and left, starting from the
Rio, mounds, hillocks, and vestiges of ruins are noticeable. To
the south, the Rio Chacamas washes the base of lofty peaks,
which, on this side, encompass the last traces of habitations; the
path winds up broad rising ground, seemingly artificial. At a
turn of the road, the men carrying our baggage admonish us to
look at the palace, which we should never have spied out owing
to the luxuriant vegetation which completely hides it. But before
we describe the ruins, we will say a few words respecting Cortez’
march through Acala and Honduras. Some writers, thinking the
former a city, have attempted to identify it with Palenque, an
error which we hope to be able to dispel.</p>

<p>In this ill-advised expedition, his personal retinue consisted
of two pages, several musicians, dancers, jugglers, and
buffoons, showing more of the effeminacy of an Oriental than the
valour of a hardy commander. The Spanish force, amongst
whom was Guatemozin, the cacique of Tacuba, and a number of
Indians as carriers and attendants, was swelled by 3,000
Mexicans.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> Two ships with supplies were to sail along the coast
under the command of Simon de Cuenca. From Goatzacoalco,
Cortez followed the coast, halted at Tonala, at Ayagualulco, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">Pg 219</a></span>seven leagues further crossed a river over a bridge 3,250 feet
long; next came Mazapa, whose course runs from Chiapas to
Los Dos Brazos. After this point the names mentioned by Diaz
are not known; but the march must have been continued along
the coast, since inland caciques, some even from distant Teapa,
sent Cortez fifty transports with supplies; now the only way for
canoes was by El Blanquillo and modern Tabasco. The force
must have passed near Frontera or east of it, skirting El Chilapa,
an affluent of El Tabasco, and halting at Tepetitan at the head
of Chilapa, called next at Iztapan and Acala Mayor, where Cortez
was informed by the natives that they would have three large
streams and three smaller ones to cross; probably the Usumacinta
and its tributaries. That this was the line of march is certain, for
had Cortez passed Palenque, he would have had no rivers to
cross, and could have marched south without obstacles; whereas
the <i>compass</i> and the map furnished the only clue to extricate
them from the gloomy labyrinth in which they were involved, and
Cortez and his officers, with their chart on the ground, anxiously
studied the probable direction of their route, which they decided
was to be in <i>an eastern direction</i>.</p>

<p>With the aid of the map furnished by the Indians, and such
guides as they could pick up, they continued their march through
other villages, and must have passed Ziguatepec, sixteen leagues
further, when Cortez inquired of the caciques where the <i>deep
and large river</i> he saw discharged itself, and whether they had
observed vessels sailing on the sea. He was told that the river
discharged itself at Xicalango, situated on one of the tributaries
of the Usumacinta, some twenty or twenty-five leagues from
Palenque as a bird flies—a considerable distance in these wooded
regions.</p>

<p>From Ziguatepec Cortez sent two of his followers to look
for the ships, which had orders to wait at Xicalango; but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">Pg 220</a></span>
they reached the place they found the crews had been massacred
and the ships destroyed by the Indians.</p>

<p>The Spaniards next halted at Acalan, a <i>district composed of
some twenty villages</i>; very unlike the approaches to Palenque,
which is situated on the first rising ground of the Cordillera.
Cogolludo,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> who follows Herrera, says that the capital of the
great province of Acalan was Izancanac, whose king, Apoxpalon,
had a palace sufficiently large to accommodate all the Spaniards
without displacing the inmates, and that the multitudes of Indian
auxiliaries were quartered in the town. This does not tally
with what is known of Palenque, where, save the palace, all
the houses and temples were too small ever to have made it
possible to accommodate large numbers, unless they were
distributed all over the town.</p>

<p>All the various indications we can glean with regard to
Izancanac, lead us to assume that it was situated somewhere
on the banks of S. Pedro, a confluent of the Usumacinta, an
assumption which becomes almost a certainty, since that was the
direct road to Honduras, and still more so when we find that they
held on their toilsome way in the direction of Peten, reaching
Chaltuna and Tayasal after three or four days’ march, to do which,
had they come from Palenque, they must have employed at least
twenty days.</p>

<p>But what has become of Izancanac? Where are the great
buildings which could accommodate hundreds of people? The
very site is unknown, whilst Palenque is still to be seen.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
Although it is so difficult to determine the route held by Cortez,
it affords, nevertheless, the best account we have relating to the
organisation of the regions he traversed. He observed throughout
independent caciques, a country divided into more or less important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">Pg 221</a></span>provinces, making it probable that the civilising and powerful
influence which had knit these peoples into a mighty empire, had
long ceased to be felt among these restless populations which, left
to their warlike instincts, lived in constant warfare, as, for instance,
in Yucatan after the fall of the dominant Cocomes and Tutulxius.</p>

<p>But to return. That Palenque was standing at that time, or at
any rate had not been long abandoned, is placed beyond a doubt by
Jose Antonio Calderon,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> in his letter dated 15th December, 1774,
in which he mentions having discovered eighteen palaces, twenty
great buildings, and a hundred and sixty-eight houses, in one
week, clearly proving that the forest which has grown since over
the structures had not assumed such vast proportions, and that
some idea could still be formed of the city; and if such was the case
at that date, are we not justified in our assumption that this city
was standing and inhabited at the Conquest in 1520?</p>

<p>Before Calderon, Garcia in 1729 had already mentioned the
ruins of Palenque, but unfortunately his work has not been found;
and Juarros, in his account of Chiapas,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> says: “There is no doubt
that this region has been inhabited by a cultured and mighty
nation, shown in the imposing piles of buildings at Culhuacan
and Tollan, traces of which are noticeable near Ocosingo and
Palenque.” <i>Tollan</i> (Palenque), Culhuacan (Ocosingo), bespeak
that these names were still remembered by the Indians as late
as the seventeenth century, that they owed their origin to the
Toltecs, since the same appellations occur on the plateaux, and
were carried by the emigrants to their later settlements in
remembrance of their older ones—a constant practice among the
Indians; and their wanderings from north to south were marked
by cities and colonies having appellations which are found both
on the plateaux and in Chiapas. The same thing happens now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">Pg 222</a></span>in every new colony, for which instances might be given <i>ad
infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>Fray Tello tells us that the Spaniards found in Jalisco
localities and cities whose names existed already in the Mexican
Valley, such as Ameca, Culhuacan, Tequicistlan, Juchitan, etc.;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> and
Diaz, in his account of Rangre’s expedition, writes: “They set
out to subdue the provinces of Cematan and Tulapan in the
south.” Unfortunately the narrative stops at Cematan, and we
have to be satisfied with the bare mention of Tulapan, which is,
however, sufficient for our purpose.</p>

<p>Taking the palace as a starting-point, it may be said that
the city is built in the form of an amphitheatre, on the lowest
slopes of the lofty Cordillera beyond; its high position afforded
a magnificent view over the forest-covered plain below stretching
as far as the sea. Some travellers have fancied they saw the
sea from the summits of the temples, but it is more likely to
have been Catasaja lagoon, some ten leagues to the north, for
it is doubtful if at this height (650 feet), the ocean is visible
even on the clearest day. We find ourselves on the pyramid,
we are in the palace, and my impressions, as a mature man,
are very different to what they were seven-and-twenty years
ago, when my appreciation of the structure was very indifferent,
while now my admiration for this massive palace, these ruined
temples, these pyramids, is profound, nay, almost overpowering.
In all these structures, the builder levelled out the ground in
narrow terraces, on which artificial elevations of pyramidal form
were reared, which on the hillside were faced with hewn stones,
and divided into storeys, as we have seen at Teotihuacan. I
notice many changes since I was here before; portions of walls,
the whole front of the Temple of the Cross (No. 1) have given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">Pg 223</a></span>way, and in the Lion’s Temple the fine bas-relief over the altar
has disappeared. It is sad to calculate how much more havoc
another fifty years will make; there will be nothing, probably,
but a mass of mouldering ruins, such as are met with in the
<span class="figright350" style="width: 350px;">

<span class="caption">OUR KITCHEN AT PALENQUE,<br />IN ONE OF THE CORRIDORS.</span></span>
woods, on the low
hills, and the plain
around.</p>

<p>Whilst our men
are clearing the
palace, we penetrate
the thick
forest through
which some of our
Indians open out a
passage. We recognise
the buildings
that have
been described,
but throughout our
progress we see
nothing but heaps
of unformed ruins.
We take up our
quarters in the
palace itself; our
kitchen and dining-room
are in
the outward gallery of the eastern entrance, whilst our sleeping
apartments are in the eastern gallery of the inner wing. From
our dining-room we look out on the forest, and our bedrooms
open on the courtyard of the palace. Although Indians
as a rule are apathetic, they are brisk and energetic enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">Pg 224</a></span>
with the <i>machete</i>, with which they open out a path so rapidly
that one can walk after them a normal pace without stopping,
and they fell enormous trees as easily as Europeans would
shrubs.</p>

<p>We will begin with the palace, giving the plan of the north
portion of the corridors and the tower; we can vouch for the
accuracy of our plan, although it differs entirely from those which
have been hitherto published.</p>

<p>The palace consisted of two distinct parts (this has not been
understood by any of my predecessors, not even Waldeck); a double
gallery ran along the east, north, and west sides, surrounding an
inner structure, likewise with a double gallery and two courtyards
of different dimensions; it was a kind of covered walk or cloister
quite separate from the remaining edifice, which to the south must
have constituted the dwelling proper. The entire pile of building
was reared on the same platform, forming an irregular quadrilateral,
and if we except the galleries, nothing seems to have been
constructed systematically or on a given plan: the various parts are
of different dimensions or different heights, and the courts enclosed
within the galleries form trapezes instead of rectangles, one
measuring 6 feet 7 inches more to the north than to the south,
so that the structures are not parallel. To the south, which it is
agreed to consider as forming the dwelling apartments, this confusion
is more apparent and complete, for here they seem to have
dispensed with any plan at all; buildings large and small reared
on different levels are found, in juxtaposition, or at some
distance from each other; the roof is sloping or perpendicular, the
decorations copious or scanty according to the whim of the artist;
some of the apartments, as compared to others, are underground
and entered by gloomy steps which receive a dim light from
the south side of the pyramid, here only a few feet from the
ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">Pg 225</a></span></p>

<p>In these subterraneous apartments are three large stone tables
with sculptured edges; they are called altars, beds, sacrificial and
dining tables, by different writers, the latter appellation seems the
most probable. The independent position of the cloister is very
clear in our cut; the left pillar is seen supporting the extremity of
the frieze and the end of the roof, which terminated here as it did
on the west side.</p>

<p class="caption">PLAN OF PALACE AT PALENQUE (NORTH SIDE).</p></div>

<p>All travellers before us have surrounded the entire palace with
this gallery, as they have surrounded the great pyramid on which
the palace stands with a continuous stairway, but quite erroneously,
as is clearly shown in our photograph, which cannot be wrong,
and which presents a perpendicular wall throughout its length.
The pyramid was divided on the east, north, and west sides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">Pg 226</a></span>
which were higher, into three or four platforms of which we found
traces in the north portion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-226.jpg" width="400" height="173" alt="BASEMENT OF PYRAMID IN THE PALACE OF PALENQUE." />
<p class="caption">BASEMENT OF PYRAMID IN THE PALACE OF PALENQUE.</p></div>

<p>We have mentioned in a former chapter that similar sections
or platforms are found in all the pyramids of a certain height
discovered by us at Palenque, which, according to tradition, had
their prototypes in the Uplands; and this is particularly noticeable
on the north side of the pyramid, where the palace façade is
completely destroyed. Here, and not on the east side, as some
have supposed, was the entrance, sufficiently proved by the wealth
of ornamentation displayed on this portion of the pyramid, and
not observable anywhere else. The base was incrusted with fine
slabs some 4 feet 8 inches high, with intervening pillars in relief
some 6 feet apart, topped by a cornice of some 6 inches. Above
this stood the wall of the second platform, indicated by traces of
a stairway which occupied the centre and led to the gallery. This
pyramid was the basement on which the palace was reared; it
is irregular on all its sides, contrary to the drawings of some
explorers, who have given it a symmetrical shape and equal
elevation. It is not easy to see how the mistake could arise, for
its irregularity is very apparent. The highest elevation is found
on the north side, measuring over 22 feet; the east and west
sides slope down, ending at the south-east angle with a perpen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">Pg 227</a><br /><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">Pg 228</a><br /><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">Pg 229</a></span>dicular
corner of 6 feet 6 inches; whilst at the south-west corner
they are level with the ground. It is the arrangement of all
pyramids which were raised on platforms imperfectly levelled out;
they are always found higher on the north side facing the plain,
than on the south side towards the sierra. This was observable
in the pyramids supporting the four buildings to the north of the
palace, in the Temple of Inscriptions, the Temple of the Cross
No. 1, that of the Cross No. 2, and in the mound known as Cerro
Alto, over 487 feet high on the north side, and nearly on a level
with the crest of the low hills to the south, and many more.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-227.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="THE PALACE, OUTER FAÇADE, PALENQUE." />
<p class="caption">THE PALACE, OUTER FAÇADE, PALENQUE.</p></div>

<p>At the south-east angle of the great pyramid, is a covered
canal which drained a mountain stream from the south, but has
been long since blocked up, whilst the torrent has found a natural
bed some 75 feet from the pyramid, and falls back into the canal
162 feet beyond. Our cut of the outer façade of the east gallery
will enable the reader to see the mistake pointed out by us; it
shows clearly the extremity of the gallery, and its outline at the
angle of the frieze to the south. This outline, while restoring the
projecting cornice now wanting, faithfully reproduces the outline
of the Toltec calli, given in our chapter on Tula. The west front,
as seen in the plan and subsequent photographs, has exactly the
same arrangement, so that doubt is impossible. The same writers
have given a flight of steps to the eastern façade, while in our
drawing a perpendicular wall replaces it, and agreeably to what
has been stated, we place the stairs on the north side, where
traces were found by us. That this is its proper place is made
probable by four beautiful buildings situated on this side some
487 feet beyond, on the same platform, and apparently part of the
same pile of building. This side of the gallery was supported by
six pillars 6 feet 7 inches wide, by 12 feet high; the corner pillar
is decorated with forty katunes in fairly good preservation; the
others with bas-reliefs of two or three figures and inscriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">Pg 230</a></span>
in stucco or hard plaster, partly destroyed. Stephens reproduced
the one on the fifth pillar to the right, which stands alone, the
building it supported having fallen. It was then in good
preservation, though now much defaced; from Stephens’ drawing,
however, it would be difficult to form an idea of the high degree
of perfection of these reliefs.</p>

<p>By a lucky chance, we were able to bring to light one of
the figures, as perfect and as fresh as on the day it left the artist’s
<span class="figleft150" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/illus-230.jpg" width="150" height="262" alt="SCULPTURED FIGURE ON PILLAR." />
<span class="caption">SCULPTURED FIGURE ON PILLAR.</span></span>
hands, and from it we are able to find
out the way the artist did his work. In
our cut this relic is on the centre pillar,
which was entirely covered with a thick
calcareous coating, caused by water trickling
from the cornice; under this coating
the faint outline of three figures was just
perceptible. My first attempt to uncover
the standing figure was not successful,
for the hammer brought both the layer
of lime and part of the head of the
figure with it. I was more cautious in
attacking the sitting figure to the left,
and fortunate enough to bring it to
light without breaking so much as a
bead round his neck, a charming specimen of an art which was
not even suspected. It represents a man seated Turkish fashion,
his head turned in a contemplative attitude towards the standing
figure to the centre of the pillar, the forefinger of the left hand
pointing to him, while the right rests on his knee; his head-dress
is a kind of mitre with a tuft of feathers in strong relief, a
head-dress we shall meet again at Lorillard; a beautiful collar
is round his neck, his cape like that worn by ladies at the
present day, bracelets are round his arms, his dress below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">Pg 231</a></span>
the girdle is like the cape. I immediately had a drawing
taken of this <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>; but, having inadvertently broken
some beads and the spangles round his arm, I was surprised
to find it perfectly modelled underneath. I undressed the
figure, which was throughout beautifully finished. From this
it was clear that the artist modelled first his figures, and that
drapery and ornaments were added afterwards, which we found
was also the case for the ornamentation on the monuments,
as well as for the Toltec idols, the Tlalocs of our cemetery,
<span class="figright300" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">MEDALLION IN PASSAGE OF EAST WING OF THE PALACE.</span></span>
and some figures at
Teotihuacan.</p>

<p>The inside of the
gallery where we
had our drawing-room
and kitchen
was decorated with
medallions, personating,
in all probability,
priests and
priestesses; our cut
is of the only one
in pretty good preservation.
To judge from the head-dress and delicate features,
it portrays a woman of the same type as our sitting
figure; it is a Palenque, a conventional, a deformed type, of
which we shall speak again. The medallion is topped by four
hieroglyphics, “Katunes,” giving the name of the person,
surrounded by curious but elegant ornaments, recalling the
rococo style of Louis XV.; while to the right is seen the
outline of a head deficient of its head-dress. This medallion,
although somewhat defaced, shows as careful modelling as the
sitting figure, and seems to us very remarkable.</p>

<p class="caption">HUGE BAS-RELIEFS IN THE PALACE COURT, PALENQUE.</p></div>

<p>The east gallery measures 114 feet in length; the north
gallery, which is broken down, 185 feet; the west gallery
102 feet only; and the intervening space between the two
northern galleries, about 175 feet; consequently there is a
difference of 11 feet in the length of the north and south
galleries, proving once more the confusion mentioned above.
The main court is reached by an arch widening at the top, shaped
like a trefoil, giving access to a broad staircase of seven steps
16 inches high. On each side are sculptured, in low relief, a
group of human figures, occupying the basement of the gallery
formed by huge stone slabs inclined at the same angle as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">Pg 233</a></span>
stairs, five to the right, four to the left, representing priests in
uncomfortable attitudes. Mitres cover their heads; collars,
bracelets, and maxtlis are their only covering; the maxtli of
the first figure is covered with hieroglyphs. The court measures
upwards of 61 feet to the north and east, only 55 feet to the
south, and 71 feet to the west; in fact, as irregular as can be
well imagined. To the south of this court is a small structure
with three openings, giving some idea of what the dwellings
were like, and the curious medley of these edifices.</p>

<p>In effect, we find one sunk about the gallery to the right,
with a lower building to the left, and a frieze or perpendicular
entablature topped by a flat roof, whilst both roof and entablature
slope on the small edifice. In this portion of the palace
Stephens found some wooden fragments, of very rare occurrence
at Palenque, on account of its damp climate; while at Comalcalco,
which is older and damper still, none have been found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">Pg 234</a></span></p>

<p>The dilapidated condition of the small edifice robs it of some
of its interest; yet the interior and the frieze furnish valuable
details of ornamentation. First comes a decorative fragment
round the niches or openings in the shape of a Tau, found
both in the galleries and the apartments of the palace; next a
portion of a frieze decoration in the same building, but so defaced
that nothing is distinguishable, save the head of a fantastic
dragon, whose neck is framed with coils, palms, or feathers,
emblems of Quetzalcoatl; and lastly the ornamentation over the
entrance of a round, flat-topped edifice, by far the most interesting
because of the head seen in the centre with nose and
forehead straight, contrasting with the retreating foreheads of
the reliefs on both pillars and temples; proving that the latter
are conventional types, exaggerated likenesses of a particular
family, whether warrior or priest, rather than the faithful portraiture
of a race. We shall also find this type at Uxmal.</p>

<p>Torquemada says with regard to these deformations in
Mexico: “They defaced their faces so as to acquire an
appearance of ferocity, enlarging their ears, nostrils, and lips by
introducing silver, gold, or stone jewels. It had the twofold
use of acting as a scare against their enemies and as a personal
improvement; and that they might look fierce in war, chiefs
were obliged in some districts to make their heads long and
their foreheads broad; as Hippocrates relates of microcephales,
so did these people practise.”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> And again: “Some have pointed
heads, square flat foreheads, whilst others are like the Mexicans
and Peruvians, who had and still have heads something like a
<i>martillo</i>, hammer, or better still, like a ship (<i>navio</i>),” meaning
oblong, probably.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>Landa tells nearly the same thing as to these practices in</p>

<p>Yucatan, corroborating Torquemada. These defaced heads have
given rise to wild theories; some saw in these reliefs sun-kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">Pg 236</a></span>
who, in mythical times, had travelled thither from Europe;
it had been more natural to take them as representations of
microcephales worshipped by these people as monstrosities.</p>

<p>But to return. The east front in the inner wing of the palace
is nearly intact—the richest in ornamentation, and the portion
of the palace where the peculiarities of this architecture are best
studied. The structure intervening between the two courts
consists of two roofed galleries, supported on each side by six
pillars, enclosing five large arches. The entrance is through
the central arch, which is somewhat larger than the others, and
is preceded by a flight of steps having hieroglyphics in relief; on
each side of it were two large decorative figures, one of which
is still standing. The base, which is remarkable, has three
small platforms, sustained by sculptured pillars divided by large
retreating slabs, with small squares of hieroglyphics. The pillars
were covered on the outer and lateral sides with reliefs in
cement, vestiges of which are still discernible. The lintels over
the doorways of the gallery have disappeared; they were of
red zapote wood, and their impress is unmistakable. These
ornamental woods cannot all have long been demolished; for
in Palenque, Mr. Kohler showed me a yard-measure and a stick
he had had made out of a lintel found among the ruins.</p>

<p>These facts, taken altogether, seem to indicate that the
buildings at Palenque are not so old as is supposed. The roof
in the upper portion of the palace slopes gently, and the entablature
is so marvellously rich, that I found fresh details every
time I visited it. The frieze was decorated with seven enormous
heads; the last one to the right has still visible the mouth,
nose, and eyebrows. These heads were obtained by means of
slabs enclosed in the wall as stays to the cement, which was
modelled by the sculptor whilst in this soft state. The central
figure over the door of the gallery is the largest; each seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">Pg 237</a><br /><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">Pg 238</a><br /><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">Pg 239</a></span>to have had on either side statues life-size in high relief, and
traces of them occur throughout. Sometimes it is the distinct
outline of the fallen relief, sometimes it is a leg, sometimes
part of a torso. Near the central figure to the left, we traced
the entire lower portion of one of the figures, which brings to
our mind the fragment we found at Comalcalco (<i>vide</i> chap.
Comalcalco). If this frieze were crowned by a light cornice,
with stucco ornaments lozenge-shaped, if the roof were likewise
enriched with sculpture and reliefs, some idea would be had of
this magnificent and noble edifice. Besides a photograph, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">Pg 240</a></span>
give the restoration of the palace, as near the truth as could
be obtained with the aid of a plan and details drawn upon the
spot.</p>

<p>The gallery inside was decorated with fantastic, terrible,
monstrous figures of Indian deities. Our cut shows the best
preserved, if we except the relief, which recalls the masks
on the frieze. It may also be observed that the north end is
a plain wall, which was separated from the fallen gallery by a
narrow passage, while to the south the double gallery ended
with two apertures leading to the yard where stands the palace
tower. The gallery opposite to this is connected with the west
gallery by a narrow doorway, the interior of which is quite plain;
if medallions were here, no trace is left of them on the polished
stucco walls. This gallery opens on a small courtyard, blocked
up by the west wing of the palace to the west, by the main
gallery to the north, and by the tower to the south. This courtyard
is likewise irregular and much narrower than the other,
measuring 19 feet 6 inches to the north, and 22 feet to the
south. The basement of the gallery in this court is as rich
as in the main gallery; sculptured pillars are distributed at a
distance of 6 feet, divided by beautiful flags with katunes, which
fit admirably.</p>

<p>The tower is not the least curiosity in this wonderful palace;
trees grow over and about it, whose roots surround the walls like
iron circles; unfortunately every explorer, whether to draw or
photograph it, has had the roots of the trees removed, and this
will greatly accelerate its complete downfall. It is a square tower,
which rose by three storeys over a ground floor, ornamented to
the north with pointed niches; the top storey has disappeared,
and the great trees to the right bend over, ominously threatening
it with utter destruction. It is not unlike the Comalcalco tower;
but the decorations were in all probability less rich, for beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">Pg 241</a><br /><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">Pg 242</a><br /><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">Pg 243</a></span>some stucco coatings still facing some portions, I saw nothing
in the remains which could compare with the great decorative
subjects of that city.</p>

<p class="caption">THE PALACE, WESTERN FAÇADE.</p></div>

<p>The west wing of the palace is the best preserved, but unlike
the other two, it has no longer a double gallery. The interior
has three long, narrow apartments which open on the courtyard,
and communicate with the exterior by two doorways at each
end. The outer gallery is also the best preserved; the façade
is entire, except the centre of the north-west angle, while all
the pillars still bear traces of the beautiful reliefs with which
they were once ornamented.</p>

<p>The south end of this gallery shows clearly that the monu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">Pg 244</a></span>ment
ended here, and that the cloisters, as we have named them,
constituted a separate pile, which was divided from the group
of dwellings. Opposite to this, some 325 feet distant to the
west, rose another pyramid crowned with a temple, of which
nothing but mouldering ruins remain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="center">PALENQUE. TEMPLES.</p>

<p class="indent">Palenque a Holy City—Bas-reliefs—Rain and Fever—A Grateful Cook—Temple of
Inscriptions—Temple of the Sun—Temple of the Cross No. 1—Temple of
the Cross No. 2—Altars—Mouldings and Photographs—Fire—Explorations—Fallen
Houses—The Age of Trees in Connection with the Ruins—Recapitulation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> writers have called Palenque a capital, and the great edifice
known as the palace a royal mansion, but they have erred, for if
there was a royal palace it was not the one we have described.
Like Teotihuacan, Izamal, and Cozumel, Palenque was a holy
place, an important religious centre, a city which was resorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">Pg 246</a></span>
to as a place of pilgrimage, teeming with shrines and temples,
a vast and much-sought burial-place. In this and in no other
way can be explained the silence surrounding this great city,
which was probably peopled by a floating population dispersed
at the first alarm of the Conquest.</p>

<p>This important city is apparently without civic architecture;
no public buildings are found, there seems to have been nothing
but temples and tombs. Consequently the great edifice was not
a royal palace, but rather a priestly habitation, a magnificent
convent occupied by the higher clergy of this holy centre, as
the reliefs everywhere attest.</p>

<p>Had Palenque been the capital of an empire, the palace a
kingly mansion, the history of her people, fragments of domestic
life, pageants, recitals of battles and conquests, would be found
among the reliefs which everywhere cover her edifices, as in
Mexico, at Chichen-Itza and other cities in Yucatan; whereas
the reliefs in Palenque show nothing of the kind. On them
we behold peaceful, stately subjects, usually a personage standing
with a sceptre, sometimes a calm, majestic figure whose mouth
emits a flame, emblem of speech and oratory. They are
surrounded by prostrated acolytes, whose bearing is neither
that of slaves nor of captives; for the expression of their
countenance, if submissive, is open and serene, and their peaceful
attitude indicates worshippers and believers; no arms are found
among these multitudes, nor spear, nor shield, nor bow, nor
arrow, nothing but preachers and devotees.</p>

<p>The interest attaching to these studies is certainly profound
and sincere, yet it does not entirely banish the consciousness of
our very arduous life among these ruins. The rain is incessant;
the damp seems to penetrate the very marrow of our bones;
a vegetable mould settles on our hats which we are obliged to
brush off daily; we live in mud, we are covered with mud, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">Pg 247</a></span>
breathe in mud, whether amongst the ruins or wandering away
from them; the ground is so slippery that we are as often on
our backs as on our feet.</p>

<p>No rest for the explorer, is the fiat that has gone forth.
At night the walls, which are covered with greenish moss,
trickle down on our weary heads and awake us out of our sleep;
in the day-time we are a prey to swarms of insects, rodadores,
mosquitoes, and garrapatas. It is impossible to bear up
long against such odds, and first young Lemaire, next Alfonso
the cook, are laid up with malaria. Julian and I are the only
two of the party whom this scourge has spared. Yet this wretched
life is not without some gleams of sunshine. Since our men
opened a large space in front of the palace, and cleared the
courtyard of the dense vegetation which blocked it up completely,
allowing a free passage for the air to circulate, the birds
have not been slow to avail themselves of this new retreat,
and our mornings and evenings are cheered by their sweet
notes. We have our night concerts also, when innumerable
creatures, whose names we know not, mingle their voices with
the chirping of the cricket, the song of the cicala, the croaking
of frogs, followed by the howling of huge monkeys, which
sounds like the roaring of lions and tigers; all this is new
to us, and not without a certain amount of excitement, yet
it sinks into utter insignificance as compared with the great
joy of our discoveries, the ever fresh interest of our photographs,
the looking forward with immense satisfaction to the time
when we shall produce the splendid squeezes of these grand,
mysterious inscriptions, not yet found in any museum. Well
weighed together, these things are calculated to make us forget
the hardships and troubles of the moment.</p>

<p>Quinine has done wonders; our men are themselves again,
and Alfonso, to make us forget the meagre fare he inflicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">Pg 248</a></span>
upon us during his illness, served up a magnificent luncheon to
celebrate his recovery. The reader may like to read the menu
of a <i>déjeuner</i> in the wilds of America:—</p>

<p>Soupe: Purée de haricots noirs au bouillon d’escargots. Olives
de Valence, saucisson d’Arles. Poulet de grain, sauté a l’ail et
au piment rouge. Morue frite. Chives, pointes de petits palmiers
en branches d’asperge. Fritures: haricots noirs rissolés. Crêpes.
Fromage américain. Vins: Bordeaux et Aragon. Café, habanero
et cigares de Tabasco.</p>

<p>I am not sure about the order of succession, but I can vouch
for the items being correct, from which it may be seen that even
at Palenque, with fine weather and a grateful cook, one need not
starve, but he would be greatly mistaken who thought that this
was our every day’s fare. Let us return to graver concerns.</p>

<p>The Temple of Inscriptions is the largest known at Palenque,
standing on a pyramid of some 48 feet high, to the south-west
angle of the palace; its façade, 74 feet by nearly 25 deep, is
composed of a vast gallery occupying the whole front, and of
three compartments of different sizes, a large central chamber
and two small ones at the sides. The front gallery is pierced
with five apertures, supported by six pillars of 6 feet 9 inches by
3 feet 7 inches thick. The two corner pillars were covered with
katunes, and the other four with bas-reliefs. No sanctuary is
found in the building known as the Temple of Inscriptions, but
both the gallery and the central room have flagstones covered
with inscriptions. Two panels enclosed in the wall of the gallery
measure 13 feet wide by 7 feet 8 inches high, one in the central
chamber is over 7 feet by 6 feet. Amidst the katunes of this
panel Waldeck has seen fit to place three or four elephants.
What end did he propose to himself in giving this fictitious
representation? Presumably to give a prehistoric origin to these
ruins, since it is an ascertained fact that elephants in a fossil state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">Pg 249</a></span>
only have been found on the American continent. It is needless
to add that neither Catherwood, who drew these inscriptions
most minutely, nor myself who brought impressions of them
away, nor living man, ever saw these elephants and their fine
trunks.</p>

<p>But such is the mischief engendered by preconceived opinions.
With some writers it would seem that to give a recent date to
these monuments would deprive them of all interest. It would
have been fortunate had explorers been imbued with fewer
prejudices and gifted with a little more common sense, for then
we should have known the truth with regard to these ruins long
since. Of all the buildings the temple was the best preserved, as
seen in every detail. The floor, which in the palace is but a layer
of plaster, is laid down here with beautiful slabs 9 feet 9 inches on
one side by 5 feet by 7 inches thick.</p>

<p>The roof is unfortunately in a very ruinous state, and the
dense vegetation which covers it prevents seeing anything of
the large figures which presumably occupied its surface; even
a photograph is difficult to get, for want of sufficient space, and
the one we give is not a success.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-250.jpg" width="500" height="663" alt="TEMPLE OF THE SUN, PALENQUE." />
<p class="caption">TEMPLE OF THE SUN, PALENQUE.</p></div>

<p>Three other temples are found on a plateau, some 200 yards
south-east of the palace at the foot of Cerro Alto. First in
order is a small temple of the Sun, in a perfect state of preservation;
the front measures 38 feet by 27 feet deep. The
pilasters, the roof, and superstructure, were all covered with
sculptures and complicated decorations. Any one who is
acquainted with sacred Japanese architecture would be struck
with the resemblance of this temple to a Japanese sanctuary;
and this is very clearly seen in our cut. How is this to be
explained? A theory might be started with respect to the
probable Asiatic origin of the Toltec tribes; of the influence
of a Japanese civilisation, through the steady traffic they formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">Pg 250</a></span>
carried on, on the coast north-west of America, as also by
fortuitous immigrations resulting from shipwrecks. In the
present day, the average of Japanese vessels shipwrecked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">Pg 251</a></span>
the Californian coast is only two a year. However it may be,
we will for the present leave to others the task of elucidating
the question of origin.</p>

<p>The interior of the temple is a large room, receiving its light
<span class="figright350" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus-251.jpg" width="350" height="515" alt="JAPANESE TEMPLE." />
<span class="caption">JAPANESE TEMPLE.</span></span>
through three apertures
in the façade;
the end is occupied
by a sanctuary, and
each side by a small
dark room. The
sanctuary is a kind
of oblong tabernacle,
crowned with
a richly decorated
frieze and stuccoed
mouldings. Two
pilasters supported
the roof, and formerly
were covered
with inscriptions or
sculptured slabs representing
various
subjects; these
flags have been
broken or taken
away, and not one
remains <i>in loco</i>.</p>

<p>Those which were in the Temple of the Cross No. 1, have
already been described and a drawing given. The end of the
sanctuary is occupied by three slabs in juxtaposition, with
sculptures of a religious character; in the central portion or
tablet is a hideous face, with protruding tongue, identical with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">Pg 252</a></span>
that found on the Aztec calendar in Mexico, known as the
Tablet of the Sun. This symbolical figure is found also at
Tikal carved in wood.</p>

<p>In our cut of the Temple of the Cross No. 2, three distinct
subjects are seen: in the central slab is a cross, branching out
with palms supporting two figures; the body of the cross, which
rests on a hideous head, is sculptured in the centre, and at the
upper end are two human figures, crowned by a symbolic bird
having a long tail and eagle claws. The left slab represents a
man richly habited, with collar, medallion, girdle, and greaves;
the right slab a woman, to judge from her size, long plait of hair,
and peculiar clothing. This female is borne on palms having the
very well-preserved outline of human heads. Both the male and
female seem to stand before the symbolic bird offering presents,
the nature of which it is not easy to specify. To the rear of
each device is an inscription of sixty-eight characters, doubtless
explanatory of the ceremony the whole sculpture represents, but
which no one has yet been able to read.</p>

<p>We are of opinion that the Temple of the Cross No. 1 was a
sanctuary consecrated to Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl, and that the
altar in the same Temple No. 2 was dedicated to Tlaloc; our
only ground for this belief, however, is the cross, which we know
was a later symbolic personification of the god of rain; but we will
leave this question until we come to Lorillard, where monuments
of the same kind, and the authority of ancient writers, will furnish
data to strengthen our theory. It may not be irrelevant to add
that neither temples nor palaces were provided with doors, and
that stuff or matting curtains were used for all apertures, indicated
by the large and small rings fixed on the pilasters on each side of
the entrances, and the whole length of the inner cornice. We know
that neither the Toltecs nor Aztecs had doors to their houses,
which seems to show great respect for property, or as Clavigero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">Pg 253</a></span>
puts it, “the severity of the laws was a powerful preservative.”
What he says of Mexico is equally applicable to Palenque:
“Houses had no doors, for they deemed that dwellings were
sufficiently guarded by the stringency of the laws; and the people,
not to be overlooked by their neighbours, had curtains to all the
openings, while resounding pottery, or some other rattling object,
was suspended over the entrance to warn the inmates whenever a
stranger raised the curtain to pass into the house. No one was
allowed admittance who had not the owner’s full permission to do
so, unless the degree of relationship or necessity justified the
liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p class="caption">SCULPTURED SLABS OF SANCTUARY, IN THE TEMPLES OF PALENQUE.</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the deplorable circumstances in which I
had to work, I was able to take more than 325 square feet
of impressions; and here I take much pleasure in recording the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">Pg 254</a></span>debt of gratitude I owe Mr. de Laval for his admirable invention,
which by means of paper instead of plaster makes the taking of
impressions in distant countries comparatively easy, when the
difficulty of transport and the expense of plaster would, in our
case, have placed the reproduction of reliefs and inscriptions
entirely beyond our power. As it was, my impressions, which,
had I used plaster, would have weighed at least 30,000 lb., only
weighed 500 lb.; but even so, the taking of impressions is not so
easily effected as may be imagined, especially in a damp region
where the utmost care was required to reproduce faithfully the
delicate, faint, and defaced reliefs on these old slabs. It would
be impossible to give an idea of the immense and minute brush-work
which was required to cover 325 feet square of paper six
sheets deep.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the reliefs were only reached by a shaky
scaffolding of wet twigs; next came the drying process round
huge fires to secure the moulds against the rain getting into
them, and the stowing them speedily away before they got
spoiled. Well, but we had every reason to be satisfied with
our work; the precious squeezes had been satisfactorily stored up
in the galleries of the palace, when, on the night of January 26th,
a night I shall never forget, a hideous smell of burning startled
us out of our sleep to witness the flames which were consuming
my mouldings, the result, too, of three weeks’ hard labour, now
fast vanishing into smoke. To snatch the burning rolls and
throw them into the yard, where the Indians were ready to deluge
them with water, was the work of a moment, but, alas! to no
purpose; the mischief was irretrievable, and we had to begin all
over again. Whether done by accident or of malice prepense,
it was idle to inquire; we set to work again with renewed ardour,
and after ten days of incessant labour we brought out copies finer
than the first, and these are now to be found in the Trocadéro.</p>

<p>Our labours in the palace did not prevent our making explorations
on the hill or mountain. We had spied to the north of the
palace, some 812 feet distant, a group of four houses, or small
palaces, the ruins of which appeared sufficiently interesting to be
reproduced, which I did, after having had the southern portion
cleared of its luxuriant vegetation, when I found that the whole
length of the northern side was occupied by a dead wall, without
apertures or fronts of any kind, facing the palace and overlooking
a deep precipice. These structures, like those we discovered
subsequently, were all built on the same plan, but in various
sizes and dimensions. The inner vault of the left building,
however, is ornamented with round lines forming pretty devices,
unlike the others, which are quite plain. The pyramids on which
these structures were reared had three stories supported by
perpendicular walls. To this group of buildings belonged a
small sanctuary or chapel; notwithstanding its dilapidated con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">Pg 258</a></span>dition
it deserves mention because of some decorative remains,
which give a good idea of what must have been its profuse
ornamentation.</p>

<p>After our visit to the Lion’s Temple, now in a deplorable
state of dilapidation, we crossed the high-banked river and
reached a high level at the base of Cerro Alto, where we came
upon a cluster of buildings composed of diminutive compartments
which were used as tombs; two more were found by us
in some other buildings to the north of the palace. These
small monuments were constructed with uncemented stones,
and were in good preservation. The tombs measured 6 feet
7 inches by 1 foot 8 inches to 1 foot 9 inches wide; they
occupied the centre of the rooms and were built with flagstones;
the bodies were found with two large flat-bottomed vases,
ornamented with a little sunk flower, identical with those found
at Teotihuacan.</p>

<p>Among the innumerable ruins we discovered were five
temples; one, to judge from the height of the pyramid, which
was divided into four stories, and its noble remains must have
been important. As we descend the river to the north-west,
pyramids, ruined buildings, groups of low houses, temples, and
palaces, are found occupying the slopes of the Cordilleras,
from the crest of the lesser chain to their base. The buildings
are found on the high level and temples on eminences,
followed by a vast space apparently unoccupied, perhaps the
site of ancient gardens. To form an accurate idea of the plan
of the city would necessitate the felling of forest over several
square miles, an undertaking not to be thought of in our case.
Bridges and roads connected the various edifices; some of
these roads or streets measure several hundred yards, and I
found one bridge of 32 feet square with one single opening,
3 feet 6 inches by 9 feet 9 inches deep. All were built with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">Pg 259</a></span>
uncemented stones. Now most bridges have crumbled away,
the torrents they spanned are blocked up, and the waters are
drained through beds they have hewn for themselves, running
over the structures and depositing on their façades stalactites
which give them a strange appearance.</p>

<p>The explorer who sees the complete desolation of this ancient
city must bear in mind, that in a tropical region excessively hot
and damp a long time is not necessary to destroy even structures
of solid stone, in order to avoid attributing great antiquity
to these ruins. Now the ornamentation, both in the palaces of
Palenque, on the upper part of friezes, or the dress of figures,
consists of small rolls or round lines of plaster, studded with
diminutive spheres or dots, which, as we explained before,
were added at the very last, and is clearly seen in our
restoration. That ornamentation at once so fragile could not
last many hundred years in such surroundings, is proved by
the fact that on the least touch round lines and dots come
down, and that the ground is strewn with them. If we
examine the stairways, which on both sides of the courtyard
of the palace connected the two edifices, we shall find the
steps unworn, the stairs new; yet communication must have
been incessant, and if for long ages thousands of people
descended and ascended these stairs, would not the wear and
tear be traceable?</p>

<p>The stairs of our public buildings are worn away in no
time; if we find them entire at Palenque, it is a proof that
they were not long trodden. Nor is this all. The roofs, the
walls and courts of the palaces are so well hidden under the
thick vegetation which covers them, that a stranger might pass
a few yards distant and never suspect their presence. The
size of the trees growing between and over these structures
has been adduced as a conclusive proof of the age of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">Pg 260</a></span>
monuments. Waldeck calculated their age at 2,000 years and
more; Mr. Lorainzar computed that these monuments must be
1,700 years old, because he found a mahogany table made of
one single piece from a tree in these ruins. His reasoning was
based on the erroneous notion that a concentric circle represents
one year, whereas I ascertained that in a tropical country
nature never rests; for chancing to cut a twig some eighteen
months old, I counted no less than eighteen concentric circles.
To assure myself that this was not an isolated fact, I cut
branches and trees of every size and description, when the
same phenomenon occurred in exactly the same proportions.
More than this: in my first expedition to Palenque in 1859, I
had the eastern side of the palace cleared of its dense vegetation
to secure a good photograph. Consequently the trees
that have grown since cannot be more than twenty-two years
old; now one of the cuttings measuring some two feet in
diameter, had upwards of 230 concentric circles; that is at
the rate of one in a month, or even less; it follows that the
seventeen centuries of Mr. Lorainzar must be reduced to 150
or at most 200 years.</p>

<p>Stephens mentions a ceiba twenty-two years old of 6 feet
10 inches in diameter, and I noticed in Mexico some eucalyptus
not eighteen years old, measuring 6 feet 9 inches in diameter;
could these trees have only eighteen or twenty concentric
circles?</p>

<p>To recapitulate, Palenque seems to us more modern, as she
is far better preserved than Comalcalco; if the latter was inhabited
at the time of the Conquest (and we think we have
proved it), the former must have been likewise. Comalcalco was
a Toltec city just as was Palenque, and this is clearly demonstrated
in the pyramidal form given to the basement of edifices, in
the invariable shape of the monuments, bearing so striking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">Pg 261</a></span>
resemblance to the Toltec calli, in the fragments, in the masks of
terra-cotta, the pottery, and the small figures, facsimiles of those
we found on the plateaux; in the cultus of the cross, emblem
of the Toltec Tlaloc, and lastly in the important quotations from
Juarros and Diaz, affirming that Palenque was called Tula.</p>

<p>We shall leave for the present this Toltec branch which
founded Ocosingo, Colhuacan, and other cities of the Uplands,
to visit the other branch which settled in the Yucatan peninsula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will next proceed to the study of the Toltec branch which
penetrated the Yucatan peninsula by Patonchan, and from which
the reigning family of the Cocomes were descended.</p>

<p>The main harbour on the north-east coast was formerly Sisal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">Pg 263</a></span>
but the requirements of an increasing trade have moved it on
to Progreso, where we cast anchor in a gale of wind which
obliged us to remain five or six miles outside, to keep clear
of the shoals which make this coast dangerous. We land
with considerable difficulty at last, and are not sorry to get
rid of the unpleasant sensation known as sea-sickness. The
peninsula has no rivers and no water, and is of calcareous
formation; flat and barren to the north, where the soil is but
few inches deep; more hilly and productive towards the centre,
because of its older formation; it rises to the south to the
Sierra Madre, which runs through Central America.</p>

<p>The direction of Yucatan is from north to south, between
the eighth and twelfth degree longitude east of Mexico, and
between the eighteenth and twenty-second degree of latitude.
The first to mention it is Columbus, who, on July 30th, 1502,
finding himself at Pine Island, saw a large barque manned
by twenty-four rowers, having a cacique and family on
board, dressed in the costume known since as Yucatec; the
boat was freighted with cacao, tortillas, and a beverage
made of Indian corn, wooden swords with blades of obsidian,
copper axes, and cotton tissues as soft as silk, dyed in brilliant
hues.</p>

<p>A reasonable doubt may be entertained as to this canoe, said
to have measured 8 feet wide, having come from Yucatan, a
country by its nature exceedingly dry, arid, stony, and without
rivers, circumstances hardly favourable to making sailors of its
inhabitants; moreover, copper axes and obsidian blades were
scarce among the Mayas, and the Spaniards, under Grijalva,
never met them until they reached Tabasco.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> It seems, therefore,
probable, that the canoe came from Tabasco, a region
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">Pg 264</a></span>civilised like Yucatan, intersected by large rivers, clad with
an exuberant vegetation, noble cedar and mahogany trees,
from which to build capacious boats. As for the dress, it is
nearly the same as that worn by the Mayas; but what is
even more significant is that cocoa is one of the chief productions
of Tabasco, and is only known as an importation in
Yucatan,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> except indeed towards Patonchan, where, at the time
of the Conquest, the vegetation was as vigorous, and cacao
as extensively cultivated as in Tabasco. The Maya language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">Pg 265</a></span>was common to both districts. Had Columbus followed the
canoe, he would have added to his own the glory Cortez
achieved later; at all events he had been the first to discover
the central regions of America.</p>

<p>The first to visit Yucatan was Vincente Yanez Pinzon, who
with Diaz Solis, in 1505, coasted the eastern side, without,
however, identifying it. In 1511, Valdivia was wrecked on
the Alacranes reefs on his way to Cuba; he and his crew effected
a landing, when the only survivors of the ill-usage of the natives
were Gonzalo Guerrero and Geronimo de Aguilar, of whom
I shall speak later. In 1517, Cordova sailed along the
northern coast, where he observed great cities and high pyramids;
he landed at Campeche, and saw stately temples, having
serpentine walls in relief, similar to that of the great temple
in Mexico, dedicated to Cukulcan (Quetzalcoatl). He landed
at Patonchan or Champeton, when the natives massacred fifty-seven
of his companions. It would seem strange that Cortez,
in all his encounters with the natives of the Uplands, should
have had so few casualties, were it not known that they strove
to take their enemies alive that they might offer them on the
altar of their deities. To this prevailing custom Cortez twice
owed his life during the siege of Mexico, but as he was being
led away to be sacrificed to their war-god he was both times
rescued by his companions.</p>

<p>In Yucatan and Tabasco, where Aztec influence was of
recent date, the introduction of human sacrifice comparatively
new, the natives killed rather than captured their enemies; and
this explains the great losses sustained by the Spaniards
in the peninsula, and is another proof of Toltec teachings in
these districts.</p>

<p>In 1518, Grijalva landed at Cozumel, when he perceived
on the opposite coast a city supposed to be Tuloom-Pamal or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">Pg 266</a></span>
Paamul; he followed the route of his predecessor and halted
in the Islands of Sacrificios and Uluo, opposite the site of
future Vera Cruz; and lastly Cortez, who, in 1519, found here
Aguilar and further on in Tabasco Marina.</p>

<p>The name of Yucatan is variously derived from <i>Chacnuitan;
Tectecan, tectetan</i>, “we don’t understand,” from a
misunderstanding by the Spaniards when the natives were
questioned about the name of their country; or from <i>Yuca-Tan</i>,
“land of yuca,” not to be confounded with the yuca
of our gardens, for the former yielded a substance out of
which the Spaniards made <i>cazabe</i>, bread; and <i>Ciu-Than</i>, “say
yourself,” or, according to Landa, <i>Ulumil y etel Ceh</i>, “land
of turkeys and deer.” Another authority, Ramesal, believes
the name to be derived from Tectetan-Ylatli and Teloquitan;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
Cogolludo adopts these various appellations, remarking that
as the country was named after its chief city, it differed at
each successive epoch, being in ancient times Mayapan, but in
the time of the writer Campeche. Ternaux-Compans declares
that from the fall of Mayapan to the coming of the Spaniards,
the country had no general name, but was severally called
after each province, as district of Choaca, Bakhalal, Campeche,
etc.; but there is little doubt that the name of
Yucatan, at the coming of Europeans and afterwards, was
Maya. However that may be, we will turn to the monuments,
which afford a far surer guide whereon to construct a
history of this country so rich in works of “los antiguos.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-267.jpg" width="500" height="345" alt="PANORAMIC VIEW OF MERIDA." />
<p class="caption">PANORAMIC VIEW OF MERIDA.</p></div>

<p>Progreso is a miserable hamlet surrounded by low-lying
swamps; here the luggage is examined, but in our case only
<i>pro formâ</i>, and we are glad to resume our seats and to
steam out of this unhealthy zone, although the country we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">Pg 267</a><br /><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">Pg 268</a><br /><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">Pg 269</a></span>traverse, on which nothing grows save brambles and brushwood,
is no less flat or monotonous. We come presently to
immense estates of <i>henequen</i>, a kind of agave, having long
narrow leaves, yielding a solid shining thread, which is hardly
known out of American markets; patches of verdure, bananas,
palm-trees, and maritime pines, betray now and again a private
residence, while smoking mills show the factories where the
henequen is being prepared ready for exportation.</p>

<p>Were it not for the mysterious spirit of “los antiguos,”
which seems to fill the whole country, the landscape to a
less enthusiastic explorer must appear dreary and melancholy
in the extreme. We pass eminences on our right on which
once stood noble temples; these remains carry me back to
the time when I first visited these parts, and when these ruins
fixed my resolve to make archæology the business of my life.
Next came a few straggling hamlets; groups of dark women
in short petticoats, and naked urchins, gaze on us with
wondering eyes as they stand at the entrance of their huts
while we speed along. We reach Merida after a run of three
hours over a distance of ten leagues, where we learn that no
hotel or house is to be found, and it is only after searching
the whole place that we can at last secure a room of some
fifteen feet square, in which my two companions and myself
have to settle down. There is but one atrociously bad
restaurant where to get any kind of food; our thoughts, however,
are taken up with exploring the ruins rather than with
a good <i>maître d’hôtel</i>; we find, besides, a small Anglo-American
colony, and in their midst our abominable fare is
soon forgotten.</p>

<p>Francisco de Montejo, who founded Merida, had occupied
Chichen in 1527, but had been compelled to abandon it and
seek reinforcements in Mexico. On his return he was enabled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">Pg 270</a></span>
through a traitorous cacique, to establish himself here, and built
Merida in 1542. The conquest of Yucatan was longer and
beset with greater difficulties than that of Mexico; here the
Spaniards were continually threatened by a warlike population,
ever on the alert to raise the standard of rebellion. The history
of this people can only be read on the monuments they have
left, which have given rise to so many divergent hypotheses.
Yet documents were not wanting, and had the religious zeal
of the men of that time been less ill-judged, they would have
found in the various and multiform manuscripts, in the charts
or maps, in the idols, in the pottery and living traditions,
ample and reliable materials from which to write an exhaustive
history of the Maya civilisation. But the Spaniards were more
careful to demolish than to preserve. Zumarraga, Bishop of
Mexico, destroyed all the Aztec annals he could lay his hand
upon, and Landa, Bishop of Merida, made an auto-da-fé of
all the monuments he could collect, having done which, he
set himself to writing his history, “De las Cosas de Yucatan.”<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>All there now remains for us are mere gleanings, the
interpretation of certain passages in this very Landa, in Cogolludo
and Herrera, and above all by a careful comparison between
these monuments and bas-reliefs with those we already know; for
with their help only can we hope to reconstruct a past which
becomes more familiar the more it is studied. These monuments
have been endowed with fabulous antiquity; whereas, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">Pg 271</a></span>strength of my explorations, I assert that they are comparatively
recent.</p>

<p>Merida stands on the site of ancient <i>Ti-hoo</i> or <i>T-hoo</i>, one
of the chief cities of the peninsula; but nothing positive is
known, and tradition is almost silent respecting it. If we are
to believe the Spaniards, it had long been abandoned on their
arrival; but this is not borne out by facts, for although they
beheld a dense vegetation amidst the pyramids, the edifices
on their summits were entire;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> moreover, Montejo was able
to quarter his troops here, as well as the Indian contingent
from Mani. Furthermore, Eligio Ancona, the modern Yucatec
historian, describes a celebrated sanctuary known as <i>H-Chun-Caan</i>,
“The centre and foundation of heaven,” which was
the object of great veneration; it follows therefore that its
imposing ceremonies were presided over by revered and powerful
priests, that the temples and palaces in Merida were standing
after the arrival of the Spaniards,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> although not in the vast
proportions assigned to them by the Abbé Brasseur, whose lively
imagination is apt to lead him astray.</p>

<p>Merida was built with the materials of the Indian city,
and like all the Spanish places of the New World, is but a
huge chess-board, with streets running at right angles, consisting
of square blocks of buildings. The centre is occupied
by a large plaza, having a waterless fountain and gardens,
the flowers of which are perishing for want of water; as for
the young trees planted about, they doubtless will afford shade
to future generations; for the present the glare of this open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">Pg 272</a></span>space is intolerable. When I visited it some twenty years
ago, if not so symmetrical it was certainly more picturesque.
In the plaza are found the municipal palace and the cathedral,
<span class="figleft350" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus-272.jpg" width="350" height="557" alt="MONTEJO’S HOUSE, MERIDA." />
<span class="caption">MONTEJO’S HOUSE, MERIDA.</span></span>
of monumental proportions
for a place
of 30,000 souls; it
numbered, probably,
only the
third of this when
it was built in 1598.
Its erection cost the
pious Meridans
£60,000, equivalent
at the present
day to fifteen times
that sum, but it is
doubtful if even
with its greater
population so large
a sum could now
be raised. The
front, 179 feet wide,
is occupied by a
central pavilion in
which the principal
entrance intervenes,
ornamented
by an indifferent
Corinthian portico, over which, at a height of some 97 feet, a
great vaulted arch supports an elegant gallery; on each side of
the pavilion are two steeples with a number of galleries narrowing
in upward succession, forming with their balustrades a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">Pg 273</a><br /><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">Pg 274</a><br /><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">Pg 275</a></span>pleasing contrast to the plain façade. The interior of the
church, 289 feet long, is imposing; it consists of three naves
with round arches, supported by twelve immense columns,
and twenty of like dimensions imbedded in the walls. Small
chapels run along the sides, and the structure altogether
bears the impress of solidity which is so conspicuous a feature
of the conquerors’ work. To the south of the square stands
Montejo’s house, bearing the date of 1541; it is the oldest
in Merida, and an interesting specimen of that epoch. It
may be worthy of mention that the sculptures in this house
are as defaced as those of the Indian monuments, which
seems to indicate similarity of date. The pillars on each side
of the entrance bear aloft two Spanish soldiers, whilst on the
first floor, by the window, knights armed cap-à-pie are standing
on two recumbent Indians, personating the subjugation of the
race. The façade with its columns, statues, arabesques, and
shields, is a fair specimen of American Renaissance; but if
the composition was Spanish, the work, probably, was due to
Indian hands, for at the time of its erection the Spaniards
were a handful of soldiers or adventurers, whose pride would
not have suffered them to do any manual labour.</p>

<p>Artisans were plentiful among the Mayas, who have interspersed
their country with so many remarkable monuments,
and whose building aptitude is notable even at the present
day. Beside these edifices the town, with very few exceptions,
is an assemblage of low houses having but the ground floor,
while all the windows are stoutly grated to secure the inmates
against housebreakers. But the impression produced by this
unpromising exterior soon gives place to agreeable surprise
on being introduced into spacious apartments opening on the
“patio,” encompassed by Moorish cloisters. The patios are
planted with flowers, shrubs, and palm-trees, which, towering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">Pg 276</a></span>
above the terraced roofs, break the monotonous lines of the
town panorama. Our cut shows Don Alvaro Peon’s house
with its charming gallery on the first floor.</p>

<p>All movement and life centre towards the market-place,
where Spaniards, Indians, and Meztizos are seen in their
picturesque costumes; sellers are crying out their goods, consisting
of pottery and baskets, the facsimiles of those we
bought at Tula; somewhat further we come across some
natives bending under heavy loads of “ramon,” the green
twigs of a particular tree, affording the only forage in a
country without grass. Here young caballeros are stopped by
cumbrous carts taking up the whole street with their enormous
bales of henequen; further on, women in snowy white costumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">Pg 277</a></span>
sit in long rows, offering with a pretty grace their small
stock-in-trade spread before them. Among this motley crowd
I spied a diminutive “aguador” looking so bonnie that I wished
to take his photograph, making his less favoured companions
envious thereat.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>The Mayas, both in type and language, are unlike both
the surrounding tribes and those of the plateaux; they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">Pg 278</a></span>said to be an ancient race, but this assumption is based on
no positive proof. Cogolludo believes the first inhabitants to
have come from Cuba; and Agassiz, who studied these
tribes in their respective homes, leans to the same opinion.
Traditions and ancient writers, confirmed in modern times by
Humboldt, all are unanimous in asserting that this country
was invaded towards the end of the eleventh and the beginning
of the twelfth century by the Toltecs.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Granted their
building genius, seeing that both the architecture and the
decorations of the edifices correspond to the descriptions left
by historians respecting Toltec palaces and temples of the
Uplands, we are in a position to affirm that there was no
other civilisation in Central America except the Toltec civilisation,
and that if another existed, our having met with no
trace of it gives us the right to deny it altogether.</p>

<p>When two civilisations come in contact, the outcome is a mixture
of both which is easy of recognition. Take as an instance
India after the Mohammedan Conquest, where Indo-Arabic monuments
are notable to the most inexperienced eye. If, therefore,
Yucatan had possessed an indigenous civilisation, we
should certainly have found monuments or ruins indicating as
much; or if destroyed by time, we should have found others
of a composite character, showing the fusion of the two races,
whereas nothing of the kind occurs, and the older monuments,
or those which appear so, are in no respect different from
the more recent or Toltec ones. Consequently the Mayas,
who were peculiarly well fitted for receiving a superior culture,
had their share in the artistic manifestations to be met with
through the length and breadth of the peninsula, and being
the stronger nationality they opposed a stouter and longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">Pg 279</a></span>resistance to the hated invaders. Even now, after three
centuries of degrading oppression, a Maya, or Maya-Toltec,
preserves distinctive characteristics by which he can be singled
out from among a number of different nationalities, nor would
it be easy to find among the rural classes of Europe men of
a better build, or with more intelligent and open countenances.
Their heads are round, their eyes black, their noses arched,
their ears and mouth small, they are deep-chested, straight-jawed,
with round chin and sound square teeth, their hair is
black, straight, and coarse, their complexion reddish brown.</p>

<p>The form of government was monarchical and almost absolute;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">Pg 280</a></span>
below were the nobles, the priests, the people, and the slaves.
Such a partition, amounting to almost castes, presupposes an
anterior conquest. The lands were divided between the crown,
the nobility, the temples, and the people. The division was
by no means equal, by far the greater proportion being
appropriated by the king, the aristocracy, and the temples. The
lands of the people were the common property of the community
and not of individuals. Every member of the community had
a portion suitable to his position and requirements, which he
was entitled to hold as long as he cultivated it. As the soil
was very poor, no plough was used in ancient times, nor later
by the Spaniards. Four-fifths of the land was suffered to lie
fallow, and every five years the brushwood was cut down and
burnt to manure the ground ready to receive the Indian corn.
The work was chiefly done by men; the women planting the
seed, husking the corn, and doing such light labours as were
suitable to their weaker frames. The peasants were bound
to till the land for their lord, to supply him with game, fish,
flowers, salt, and other comforts, and to accompany him in
battle.</p>

<p>The campaigns were short, sharp, and severe; for as commissariat
was unknown, they were generally decided in one
engagement, when no pity was shown the vanquished, no
quarter given, and what could not be plundered was destroyed.
This explains the number of ruined cities which were rebuilt
and the new monuments erected after each war. Diaz remarks
that the military dress of the warriors consisted of a breast-piece
made of quilted cotton, which was completely arrow-proof,
and was adopted by the conquerors in place of their heavy
steel armour. Their head-dress was a casque ornamented
with rich feathers, prominent amongst which were the quetzal.
The rank and file wore no clothing except the <i>maxtli</i> in battle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">Pg 281</a></span>
but by painting their faces and bodies in grotesque patterns
of brilliant colours, and covering their heads with raw cotton,
they presented a fierce and gaudy appearance. Painting the face
and body with red, black, and white was universal; on the
return from an expedition the warrior’s paint was substituted for
tattooing. “Stripes, serpents, animals, and birds,” says Cogolludo,
“were the favourite devices for this kind of decoration, according
to their military order; the warrior being entitled to a fresh hieroglyph
after each notable feat of arms, an old veteran came to
have his whole body covered with them.”</p>

<p>Owing to the warm climate the Maya dress was simple
and scanty in the extreme. Men wore almost universally the
<i>maxtli</i> (a long strip of cotton cloth, wound round the loins);
children up to two years of age wore no clothes at all; the
baby girls, like those in Java, had a string round their waist,
from which depended a shell, the removal of which was looked
upon as sinful. The dress of the nobles, both men and women,
consisted of loose tunics and flowing mantles dyed in brilliant
and variegated colours. The hair was worn short, cut in a
fringe on the forehead; no beard was allowed, and the few
hairs that made their appearance on the face were immediately
extracted. Squinting was fashionable, and mothers ensured it
for their daughters by suffering a tuft of hair to hang over
their eyes. Their ears, nose, and lips were adorned with jewels.
Cranial disfigurement seems to have been confined to the priests
and nobles.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> According to Landa,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> four or five days after birth
the child was laid with the face down on a bed of osiers, and
the head compressed between two pieces of wood, one on the
forehead and the other on the back, the boards being kept
in place for several days until the desired cranial flattening was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">Pg 282</a></span>effected. This Spartan process was often attended with
disastrous results. Tamenes practised this flattening on the
forehead only, which was thus better adapted to the carrying
of burdens. Disfigured Tamenes skulls were found by us at
Teotihuacan, and on the pottery of Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>Eligio Ancona draws a mournful picture of the Mayas before
the Conquest: “They were much oppressed by the king, the
nobles, and in a special manner by the restless and ambitious
caciques constantly at war with each other; the education of
the youth of both sexes rested entirely with the priests, the
clans of the people were ignorant and degraded; men were
sold in the market or sacrificed on the altars; women excluded
from society and the family circle,” etc. The nation prospered
in spite of it all; the country was densely populated, while the
monuments everywhere attest that the arts flourished.</p>

<p>What have the Spaniards done for them? Have they relieved
their misery, dispelled their ignorance, minimised their vices?
The peninsula counted millions before the Conquest; there are
not a hundred thousand at the present day, and they are more
sunk and wretched than at any time of their existence. For
a nation is always found to have the religion and the Government
best suited to its character or degree of civilisation; let extraneous
institutions, whether civil or religious, however superior, be imposed
upon them, they seem only to stultify and dishearten a
people they were not intended for.</p>

<p class="caption">MESTIZOS’ HOUSE.</p></div>

<p>Meztizas are one of the chief attractions of Merida; they
are looked upon as an inferior caste, but this they seem
to accept with indifference, revenging themselves on society
by their attractive ways, which it is not given to man to resist;
for even those who are not beautiful, and they are few, have
a winning grace, a peculiar charm all their own. To
a certain extent this is due to their becoming costume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">Pg 283</a></span>
which consists in a loose tunic with short sleeves and square
body, leaving arms and neck bare; this tunic, <i>uipil</i>, is tastefully
embroidered at the neck, arms, and bottom with red, blue, or
green devices; the under-skirt, <i>fustan</i>, is trimmed with rich
lace, while their clustering black hair is set off by a silver arrow;
they wear rings on their fingers, and chains of gold depend
from their lovely necks, often constituting their whole dowry.
Meztizos have a quarter at the outskirts of the town allotted
to them, where they inhabit oblong thatched cottages decorated
outside with a diamond pattern showing where the lines join.
It is probable that these huts are identical with those of
the Mayas of ancient days, while there is no doubt as
to the decorations being like the mouldings of the old palaces.
A hamac, one or two trunks to put their clothes in, a <i>butaca</i> or
low leather arm-chair, compose the sole furniture of these poor
dwellings. From a little distance, the Meztizo quarter looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">Pg 284</a></span>
like a cool, pleasant grove, for each hut stands on ground
covering a quarter of an acre planted with ramon. Meridan
ladies are never seen out of doors except at church, or during
their evening drive. Church hours are unusually early here,
beginning at three a.m., when all the bells of the town are
set ringing, to awake, I suppose, a slumbering population.</p>

<p>Meridans are sociable and more conversant with the questions
of the day than might be expected: two scholars, Eligio and
Canon Ancona, have written both of the times preceding and
those following the Conquest; while the rising generation of
men is studious, intelligent, and manly; literary meetings,
periodicals, reviews, concerts, theatres, and dances, keep the
population pleasantly occupied. The civility I experienced with
regard to my mission was very welcome and flattering to my
self-respect, the good canon presenting me with an obsidian
sceptre, a marvel of workmanship, now to be seen in the
Trocadéro. This people, unlike the Mexicans of the Uplands,
are good men of business, and what trade or industry the
country possesses is entirely in their own hands. They have
the characteristics of a race in its manhood, enduring, self-possessed,
patient, and industrious. The only falling off
noticeable (due to the climate) is a diminution in their stature,
and a disproportionately large female element. Never were
their qualities better tested than during their social war,
when they stood single-handed and succeeded, after years
of hard fighting and sore distress, in recovering their municipal
rights.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>Their soil may be poor, they may not have mineral wealth
like their neighbours, but their thrift and industrious habits
bring their own reward. It would be interesting to tell the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">Pg 285</a></span>long struggle of this gallant people to regain their independence;
suffice it to say that the risings of the natives
began in 1761, to break forth into a formidable insurrection
in 1846, which has continued with hardly any interruption to
the present day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-285.jpg" width="500" height="418" alt="A STREET IN MERIDA." />
<p class="caption">A STREET IN MERIDA.</p></div>

<p>The Indian, whether his spirit is broken by long oppression,
or from some other cause, seems to shrink and melt away
at the approach of the white man, and to retire more and
more from the beaten paths of civilisation.</p>

<p>The environs of Merida are interspersed with numerous
haciendas; amongst these Ascorra is certainly one of the most
picturesque. Three <i>norias</i>, or deep wells, give ample water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">Pg 286</a></span>
for the requirements of the household, the irrigation of the
garden, and the plantation.</p>

<p>The house, with its verandah festooned with creepers, its
flower-beds, shrubs, and palms, is a charming picture of
beauty and comfort; multitudes of ducks, mandarins, swans,
and flamingoes people the ponds, while rills of water cool the
air and add to the enjoyment of this lovely spot. Here I
noticed for the first time a liana bearing a curious large
flower of 1-1/2 feet long by 9 inches wide, with a filament of
more than 1 foot 9 inches, making over 3 feet altogether.
The colour is bluish green outside, while the inside is like
a spring muslin, with red devices on a dazzling white ground,
deepening down the calyx into a rich red velvet bordered with
prone hairs. The bud resembles a web-footed animal swimming,
hence its name <i>flor de pato</i>, “duck’s flower.” It may
not improperly be compared to an immense aristochia. This
liana was, I believe, imported from the Antilles; but nothing
is perfect in this world, not even this marvellous flower,
which astonished both Agassiz and myself, for no sooner is
it fully blown than it stinks so abominably that its immediate
removal becomes an imperative necessity.</p>

<p>To lay out this lovely garden, it was necessary to blast the
rocks forming the crust of this country; and as the work is
still going on, it enabled Mr. Agassiz to study its formation,
which, like Florida, belongs to the recent Tertiary epoch. We
tarried but one day at Ascorra, for we wished to visit the
Tepich Hacienda, where the largest henequen factory in these
parts is to be seen, worked by machinery, a great innovation for
this country. The exports of this important industry are
reckoned at £600 a year. The want of hands, however,
precludes the possibility for the present of any scheme being
mooted to give it greater extension. The country is not suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">Pg 287</a></span>ciently
favoured to tempt immigrants; unless it were Malay
coolies, who would not suffer from the climate, and who,
moreover, when crossed with Meztizas or Indian women, would
produce a magnificent race.</p>

<p>We resume our seats for Acanceh, formerly a populous centre,
as testified by three great pyramids still extant in the plaza,
which supported ancient temples on their summits. In one of
them which furnished the material for the builders of the station,
fine sculptured blocks, like those employed at Uxmal for building
purposes, were found; together with several funeral objects, fine
obsidians, a magnificent sceptre, in my possession, and vases
identical with those we unearthed at Teotihuacan. These
affinities and resemblances between Yucatec vestiges and those
of the Uplands, are of constant occurrence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> our return from Merida, an expedition to Aké was organised
consisting of the American Consul, Mr. Aymé, his wife, her
pet dog Shuty, and ourselves. Mr. Aymé is an energetic archæologist,
well acquainted with the ruins, so that his offer to
accompany us was most welcome. The ruins of Aké are on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">Pg 289</a></span>
a hacienda which belongs to Don Alvaro Peon, from whom a
permit was easily obtained; he furnishing us besides with a
large hamper to supply our wants, which his Chinese cook was
to take to the hacienda.</p>

<p>Journeys in the interior of the peninsula may be performed
either by diligence or “volan coché,” a national vehicle, made
entirely of wood, save the iron tires of the wheels. An oblong
box balanced on two leather springs is placed on a heavy underframe,
the bottom of the carriage lined with a stout flax net,
on which is spread a mattress, to deaden to some extent the
jolting of these abominable roads. The coachman sits in front,
while the back is occupied by the baggage; when the <i>coché</i>
has but one occupant, he generally lies full-length on the
mattress; but if not he sits Turkish fashion, which in time
becomes very irksome to one not to the manner born; as to
the natives, it seems to be immaterial how many are packed
away in a “volan.” Although well hung, the swaying of these
<i>cochés</i> is truly amazing, especially when the driver is drunk
and sets his mules full gallop; but most wonderful of all is that
nothing ever happens, and in my numerous expeditions I was
only once upset.</p>

<p>Aké lies ten leagues east of Merida, which can be reached
by the Izamal road, through immense estates of agave, leaving
on the right two mounds covered with ruins and passing Tixpénal,
a wretched-looking village, as indeed is the whole country
around; but the half-burnt, tumbled-down hovels are the work
of the revolted natives, who in 1846 occupied the village and
set fire to it.</p>

<p>Some three leagues further lies Tixkokob, where we halt to
have a cup of chocolate. The inhabitants are great hammock-makers,
and through the open doors, multicoloured nets may
be descried in every stage of progress. They are the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">Pg 290</a></span>
beds used by the natives, and cost from half-a-crown to four
shillings, but those made at Valladolid are more expensive.
Here we leave the main road for a cross path, when we may
be said to become fully acquainted with a <i>coché’s</i> peculiarities.
We are rocked to and fro in the most alarming manner;
we hold on to the net like grim death, for fear of being
pitched out on the stony road or landed among prickly pears
at every turn. It is with a sigh of relief that we reach Ekmul,
long after the curfew has been sounded, and the place lies wrapped
in the silence and deep shadows of night. We found the
hacienda strongly bolted, for the inmates had given us up;
but the loud barking of the dogs brought Don Peon’s mayordomo,
and we were soon made at home and as comfortable as the
somewhat dilapidated nature of the dwelling would allow.</p>

<p>We were up at early dawn, when we found under the thatched
verandah a number of Don Peon’s servants, with hatchets and
<i>machetes</i>, awaiting our orders for clearing the main pyramid, and
while so engaged, we proposed to visit a <i>cenoté</i> lying on the
other side of a thick wood containing various ruins. This hacienda
is stocked with horned cattle, and we were warned to provide
against garrapatas, the most terrible wood-lice in existence. We
had taken, or fancied we had taken, all the precautions which
the ingenuity of man, alarmed at the approach of danger, could
devise. But against the voracity of a famished garrapata what
can avail? This insidious insect is invisible in its early youth;
thinner than the thinnest paper, it steals, it creeps in quite
easily between two stitches!</p>

<p>But what is a “cenoté”?</p>

<p>Although Yucatan is uncut by rivers or streams, an immense
sheet of water and ill-defined currents occupy its under
surface; these waters are near the surface along the coast,
but low down in the interior of the peninsula, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">Pg 291</a></span>
calcareous layer is of great thickness. Localities where these
waters can be reached, whether through the natural subsidence
of the soil or artificial pits, receive the name of <i>cenoté</i>.
When the water flows at a slight depth, and the calcareous
layer has only been partly eaten away, there follows an irregular
sinking which forms a cave open from side to side; but when
the crust is thicker, and the stream has a regular course, the
soil is generally corroded in a circular space; and the vault
thus formed lacking support, falls in, when an immense open
well is made, as for instance at Chichen-Itza. Often the
crust is so deep, that the soft parts only crumble down or
are carried away, leaving frequently a small aperture towards
the top, fashioning a real grotto with stalactites and stalagmites,
as at Salacun and Valladolid. It sometimes happens that the
calcareous crust is exceedingly thick, when a gigantic subterraneous
passage is formed, as at Bolonchen; in a word, all
the varieties which are produced by the silent work of an
undisturbed stream in a friable soil, may be witnessed. It
is worthy of note that most civilised centres in Yucatan rose
around these natural reservoirs; for the early settlers were
probably unacquainted with the means of sinking artificial wells
or cisterns, as they did later at Uxmal.</p>

<p>The Aké cenoté is thirty feet below the surface, and
belongs to the early series of these natural phenomena. It forms
a gigantic vault slightly curved, to which the accidents of the
rock give a picturesque and grand aspect. The bottom is
occupied by an extensive piece of clear fresh water, peopled
by a multitude of small fish some three inches long, while
thousands of swallows flit about, filling the whole place with
their joyous twitter.</p>

<p>We left the cenoté to come back through the woods, spying
out if peradventure we could perceive any ruins from under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">Pg 292</a></span>
their deep, green shroud, brushing unwittingly past the trailing
branches of the trees, suffocating literally in our well-closed
garments; no unusual sensation, no unseemly irritation
had as yet alarmed us. Shuty was the first to show that
all was not well with her. We had already noticed some
signs of uneasiness as we emerged from the cenoté; she
would suddenly stop, to nibble her paws, or perform some
extraordinary gymnastic feat; gyrating, running, and barking
joyously at the empty space.</p>

<p>We came presently to some very intricate parts of the
wood, when the somewhat fictitious gaiety of Shuty turned
into groans of acute agony, rolling madly on the grass, biting
herself, and howling lamentably until her mistress took her into
her arms, to find her alive with garrapatas, as indeed we all
were; there was nothing for it but to return to the hacienda
as quickly as possible, and institute a minute and conscientious
investigation. A complete change of clothes became necessary,
ere we could sit down to the very excellent breakfast prepared
for us by Don Peon’s cook; as for Mrs. Aymé and Shuty,
they did not venture on the perils of another exploration in
the fated woods.</p>

<p>Here I again noticed the same curious phenomenon I
had observed at Palenque with regard to concentric circles in
the trees; on the great pyramid which Don Peon had caused
to be cleared only six months before, and which was now
thickly covered with young shoots our men were fast demolishing,
I counted no less than seven or eight circles on the twigs.</p>

<p>The ruins of Aké are hardly known; Stephens, their only
visitor besides myself, calls the gallery “colossal, the ruins of
the palace ruder, older, and more cyclopean in aspect than any
he had previously seen.” Quoting Cogolludo, apparently from
memory, he adds that the Spaniards halted at a place called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">Pg 293</a></span>
Aké, where a great battle was fought; had he read Cogolludo
properly, he would have seen that the place meant could not
be Aké, which lay out of the line of march of the conquerors.
We have had occasion to observe before that Montejo landed
on the eastern coast of Yucatan at a place now opposite to
Valladolid, where he took possession of the country; various other
points are also given, but it is certain that he made his way
to Coni in Chiapas, halted at Coba, and continued his march to
Ce-Aké, where he had to fight the Indians for two days; hence
he directed his course to Chichen-Itza, which he wished to
colonise, because “its great buildings made it easy of defence.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>
This was in 1527; but Ce-Aké was thirty-five leagues east of
the ruins of another Aké, once a populous centre, as shown
by fifteen or twenty pyramids of all dimensions, crowned with
ruinous palaces, scattered over a space of about half a square
mile. The largest are grouped so as to form a rectangle,
encircling a vast courtyard, the centre of which is occupied
by a large stone of punishment called <i>picoté</i>, of universal use
before and after the Conquest, and still found at Uxmal and
various other places. An old Indian of Tenosiqué assured me
that such a stone was standing some thirty years ago in the
plaza. The culprit was stripped and tied to the <i>picoté</i> previous
to receiving the bastinado. This custom still prevails at
Tumbala, an Indian village lying between Palenque and S.
Christobal. According to the Indian moral code, punishment
makes a man clean, and I have seen natives who, to have
a clear conscience, requested a punishment no one dreamt of
inflicting.</p>

<p>The plan we give is, unfortunately, very incorrect, but such
as it is it will enable the reader to follow out our description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">Pg 294</a></span>of the ruins. To the north-west is a three-storeyed pyramid
like those at Palenque, built with large blocks laid together
without mortar, about 40 feet high, crowned by a small
structure whose roof has crumbled away but whose walls are
still standing. We recognise the same style of structure we
observed at Tula and Teotihuacan, a style we shall meet
again both in Yucatan and in the district of the Lacandones.
It may be stated that pyramids with esplanades, both here
and at Palenque, although built with large stones, are smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">Pg 295</a></span>
than those of the monuments in other places, and if the
blocks were laid in mortar it has crumbled away like the
cement which formed the outer surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-295.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="SMALL PYRAMID OF AKÉ." />
<p class="caption">SMALL PYRAMID OF AKÉ.</p></div>

<p>The dimensions of this structure are so diminutive that
it cannot have been anything but a temple, forming part of
the next monument which it commands. The latter from its
rectangular arrangement recalls to mind the so-called fortresses
at Tula and Teotihuacan, which were in reality <i>tlachtli</i>, “tennis-courts.”</p>

<p>The third monument has given rise to many conjectures;
it is a large pyramid with an immense staircase,
presenting a new and extraordinary feature, entirely different
from all we have seen in Yucatan. Was this a specimen of
a different civilisation, or simply a particular building which
belonged to an earlier epoch?—were the questions which presented
themselves to my somewhat bewildered imagination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">Pg 296</a></span>
This strange monument is surmounted by thirty-six pillars
(only twenty-nine are still standing) each 4 feet square, and
from 14 to 16 feet high. These pillars are arranged in three
parallel rows 10 feet apart from north to south, and 15 from
east to west; whilst the esplanade supporting them is 212 feet
long by 46 feet wide, rounded off at the extremities like the
Hunpitoc pyramid at Izamal looking north-south. Each pillar
is composed of ten square stones 3 ft. 10 in. on one side,
varying in thickness from 1 ft. 3 in. to 1 ft. 6 in. A gigantic
staircase with steps some 4 ft. 7 in. to 6 ft. 7 in. long and
about 1 ft. to 1 ft. 6 in. thick, leads to the summit.</p>

<p>It was urged that all these monuments had been constructed
with uncemented stones, as neither cement nor mortar
were found at Aké. This, however, is an error, for I
observed that the builders used stones cut on the side facing
the outer surface of the pillars, leaving the inner sides uncut;
and as they did not perfectly fit one into another, but left
cavities sometimes 3 inches deep, they were filled up with
fragments of stone rubble which I found, and the whole was
no doubt smoothed and polished over with mortar or cement.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p class="caption">GREAT PYRAMID AND GALLERY OF AKÉ.</p></div>

<p>But what was this singular structure intended for? If for
a covered gallery, the wood or thatch roof has long since
disappeared and left no trace. Could it have been a commemorative
monument? We know not, save that it is the
only monument of the kind in Yucatan, and that its dimensions
are far from colossal. Not that theories are wanting;
some writers have gone so far as to imagine this monument
to have been erected to commemorate periods or reigns, and
each block to represent either a <i>ahau-katun</i>, “twenty-four
years,” or a century, <i>katun</i>, “fifty-two years.” Now, as there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">Pg 297</a><br /><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">Pg 298</a><br /><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">Pg 299</a></span>are thirty-six pillars having each ten stones, this monument
would be, by the first computation, 8,640 years old, and by
the second, 18,720. It is clear that were this the case the
first stone would have disappeared long before the last one
had been placed, and that the earlier would have looked
older than the later ones, whereas the same air of decay is
observable in all. It is more simple and consistent to suppose
this monument to have been a thatched gallery which was used
for games, meetings, or public ceremonies. Its central position
as regards other monuments would seem to bear me out. Is a
ruin to be interesting only in ratio of its obscurity and antiquity?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-299.jpg" width="500" height="345" alt="PILLARS OF THE GREAT GALLERY OF AKÉ." />
<p class="caption">PILLARS OF THE GREAT GALLERY OF AKÉ.</p></div>

<p>After the pyramid, we visited the ruin known as <i>Akabna</i>,
“House of Darkness,” in which the rooms still standing are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">Pg 300</a></span>
perfectly dark; for the only light they receive is from a
door communicating with other apartments. Here we again
find the <i>boveda</i>, the corbel roof, the pointed arch observed in
previous buildings. The Aké vault is built with large rough
blocks, which has caused these monuments to be called
cyclopean, an appellation hardly deserved, for cyclopean structures
were built with far larger blocks, irregular in shape, yet
fitting so well that it would be impossible to introduce the
slightest object between the joints, whilst the stones employed
in the constructions at Aké are uniform, consisting of thick
uncut slabs, with large gaps intervening. This I observed to
Mr. Aymé: “You hold that Aké structures were built without
mortar or cement, and that no sculpture or decoration of
any kind have been found, but I lay down as a principle,
that it is altogether impossible, without wishing to deny the
very novel features of the phenomenon we are confronted
with; and nothing except the most irrefragable proofs will
bring me from my position of total denial, for I am convinced
that the builders would not have left structures so
important unfinished. If these stones fitted originally, the gaps
which are noticeable would be the work of time, and this
were to give them an impossible and incredible antiquity,
since the slabs are rounded off or sharp at the edges as if
quarried yesterday; further, both in the interior or facing
the walls, they are exactly in the same condition, from which
I conclude that all were originally laid in cement, and
coated over in the usual manner.”</p>

<p>Soon after this conversation we visited the ruin called
<i>Knuc</i>, “Owl’s Palace,” and on reaching the top of the great
pyramid, the first thing I noticed was a very pretty bas-relief
of cement, consisting of diamonds and flattened spheres, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">Pg 301</a></span>
the kind met at Palenque. This relief formed the right side
of a frame, topped by figures, traces of which were still discernible;
below the projecting cornice was a thick coating of
plaster, filling the joints, well smoothed and polished on the
surface, and also a coating of paint on the wall.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said to my companion, Mr. Aymé, “what do
you say now?”</p>

<p>“That you were perfectly right.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, this discovery proved that the monuments
could no longer be considered the work of a different race,
a different civilisation, or a hoary antiquity. In effect, their
cement decorations are similar to those of the older edifices
in Tabasco and many in Yucatan. I shall therefore distinguish
the Aké period under three heads: the <i>cement epoch</i>, the <i>cement</i>
and <i>cut stone</i>, and the <i>cut stone only</i>, when the builders used
only the latter in their decorations, examples of which are
to be found in the later edifices at Uxmal and Kabah.</p>

<p>The Aké builders lived in a country where the calcareous
layer was taken up in sheets varying from 10 inches to 1 foot
7 inches thick. They used them exactly as they came from the
quarry, thus saving great expenditure in labour. When the shell
of a structure was run up, it was thickly plastered over, painted,
and ornamented with mouldings in relief. This explains at
once why the stones on the pillars of the gallery and the blocks
of the grand stairway are irregular. The discovery of the
bas-relief and cornice filled me with joyful expectation, but
although I was indefatigable in visiting the Succuna and other
nameless pyramids, I brought to light nothing more of the
kind; everything had crumbled away. Here are also found
the typical superimposed layers of cement, which we mentioned
in various places inhabited by the Toltecs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">Pg 302</a></span></p>

<p>To sum up, Aké seems to belong to the early times of
the Toltec invasion in Yucatan; an epoch which may not
improperly be termed Maya-Toltec, as the civilisation in Tabasco
and Chiapas may be termed Tzendal-Toltec, and that of
Guatemala, Guatemalto-Toltec.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> expedition to Izamal and Chichen was a somewhat serious
undertaking: we required a large number of hands for our
work in mid-forest; we should have to camp out for three
weeks at least, removed from all human habitation; finally a
military escort, fifty strong, was deemed necessary to secure
us against a sudden attack from the revolted natives, respecting
whom alarming rumours of pillaging were afloat. Our heavy
baggage had been sent on, and armed with twelve-shot
Winchesters, and provided with letters from the Governor for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">Pg 304</a></span>
the officers in command of the district garrisons which were to
supply the escort, we started on January 4th, travelling over a
monotonous, dusty, abominable road. Our drivers, however,
were such good whips, that we went over the distance in no
time.</p>

<p>There is hardly a soul to be met on the road, save at rare
intervals some carts loaded with henequen; some natives returning
from the next village, the women veiling their faces or turning
their backs upon us at our approach; now a company of reserve
on their way to the front or homeward-bound, for the borders
are strictly guarded against a <i>coup de main</i> from the revolted
natives.</p>

<p>We stop at Cacalchen; for our early start, the crisp morning
air, and the jolting of the road, have sharpened our appetites.
We breakfast under a shaded verandah opening into a central
court planted with cocoa-trees. We are waited upon by a very
pretty Meztiza, whose fair complexion, rosy mouth, large black
eyes, and exquisite figure, are shown to the utmost advantage
in her transparent <i>uipil</i>, doing her work with simple, quiet grace,
while her presence and her bewitching smile seem to light up
the whole place. What dish would not have tasted sweet,
offered by her shapely hands?</p>

<p>Izamal, where we arrive at three o’clock, is an important
place numbering some five or six thousand souls. It looks
beautifully white, for it has just undergone its annual cleaning,
when every building is whitewashed in honour of the patron
saint.</p>

<p>It has been urged by some writers that the civilisation of
Yucatan and Tabasco belonged to a remote past; but these
writers often speak from mere hearsay, accepting everything
without the slightest criticism; their accounts, however valuable,
are filled with uncertainties, are often obscure and contradictory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">Pg 305</a></span>
so that they may be made to square with the idiosyncrasy of
all or any particular man. Consequently the difficulties in
arriving at the truth are almost insuperable, unless it is one
who has visited the regions he writes upon, studied the monuments,
collated ethnographical documents, compared the various
manners and customs, fitting himself to catch a word or a
sentence which from time to time shoots across the darkness
of their undigested narratives, and correcting with their help
errors with which they abound. But the general neglect by
ancient writers of monuments which everywhere met their gaze
makes me unjust, while our gratitude is due to such industrious
writers as Bernal Diaz, Sahagun, Torquemada, and many more.</p>

<p>Izamal, like many other places in the peninsula, was built
on the site of an Indian city; here, as elsewhere, the chief
care of the Spaniards was to destroy alike palaces, temples,
and written documents, bidding the natives forget their ancient
traditions. Landa, who wrote forty-five years after the Conquest
(1566), speaks of the edifices at Izamal as twelve in
number, adding that the founders were unknown; whilst
Lizana, sixty years later (1626), with fewer opportunities for
collecting legends, gives their history in full, together with the
Indian names and their signification; but unfortunately in his
time the monuments had dwindled down to five.</p>

<p>Landa, as we have remarked, says these monuments are of
unknown origin, yet in another place he affirms they are the
work of the existing race, since he writes: “<i>Among the
remains of monuments which were destroyed are found fragments
of human figures and other decorations, such as the
natives make even now with very hard cement.</i>” He further
mentions having found in a tomb “<i>stone ornaments artistically
wrought, similar to the currency in present use among the
natives</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">Pg 306</a></span></p>

<p>At Merida he demolished an Indian temple, which crowned
the upper part of the great mound, giving a ground plan and
describing it as “built with square blocks, beautifully carved,
and of such height as to produce a feeling of awe in the
beholder” (its real height is 80 feet); thus proving the monument
to have been entire when he wrote. Nevertheless it is
from an assertion such as this that judgment has been passed
on the monuments, and from documents like the Perez manuscript
that a chronology has been deduced. The monuments
are imposing, no doubt, to judge from the few that remain;
but we should err if, following Landa and others, we pronounced
them “colossal, gigantic, magnificent, to which nothing in the
world can be compared.”</p>

<p>The whole extent of the Yucatec monuments would not
represent in cubic metres the works achieved in Paris during
the last twenty-five years; consequently they should be viewed
as the unpretending outcome of a semi-civilised people, and this
estimate need not lessen their interest, while the mysterious
silence which surrounds them forms a void in the history of
the human race.</p>

<p>The great mound to the north is called <i>Kinich-Kakmó</i>, “The
Sun’s face with fiery rays,” from an idol which stood in the
temple crowning its summit. The monument consists of two
parts: the basement, nearly 650 feet, surmounted by an immense
platform, and the small pyramid to the north. “Great veneration
was felt for the idol or deity of Kinich-Kakmó, and in times of
public calamity, the entire population flocked to this shrine with
peace-offerings, when at mid-day a fire descended and consumed
the sacrifice, in the presence of the assembled multitude. Then
the officiating priest notified the will of the deity whether for
good or for evil, and prophesied more or less the secret longings
of their hearts: but as they could not always guess aright, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">Pg 307</a></span>
not unfrequently happened that their expectations were not
fulfilled.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-307.jpg" width="500" height="574" alt="GREAT PYRAMID, KINICH-KAKMÓ, AT IZAMAL." />
<p class="caption">GREAT PYRAMID, KINICH-KAKMÓ, AT IZAMAL.</p></div>

<p>Facing this to the south was another great mound, known as
<i>Ppapp-Hol-Chac</i>, “the House of Heads and Lightning,” the priest’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">Pg 308</a></span>house, presumably similar to those still standing in various towns
of Yucatan. The upper portion of this pyramid was levelled
down, and on its lower platform was erected the Franciscan
church and convent.</p>

<p>The third pyramid to the east supported a temple dedicated
to <i>Izamat-Ul</i>, <i>Izamna</i>, or <i>Zamna</i>, the great founder of the
ancient Maya empire. “To him were brought,” says Lizana,
“the sick, the halt, and the dead, and he healed and restored
them all to life by the touch of his hand;” hence the appellation
<i>Kab-Ul</i>, the Miraculous Hand, applied to him.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> He is often
represented by a hand only, which recalled him to the memory
of his worshippers. His other names are the Strong, the
Mighty Hand, the Long-handed Chief, who wrote the code of
the Toltecs, and as such has been identified with Quetzalcoatl,
with whom he shared the government; he conducting the civil
power, whilst Quetzalcoatl, the virgin-born deity, looked after the
spiritual.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>“The temple in which these miracles were performed, was
much frequented; for this reason four good roads had been
constructed, leading to Guatemala, Chiapas, and Tabasco.
Traces of them can even now be seen in various places.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> We
also have found marks of a cemented road, from Izamal to the
sea facing the island of Cozumel.</p>

<p class="caption">SOUTH SIDE OF HUNPICTOK PYRAMID AT IZAMAL, AFTER STEPHENS.</p></div>

<p>Lastly the fourth pyramid to the west, which is shown in
our cut of the market-place, had on its summit the palace of
<i>Hunpictok</i>, “the commander-in-chief of eight thousand flints.”
On its side near the basement, consisting of stones laid without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">Pg 309</a></span>mortar, and rounded off at the corners like those of the Aké
pyramid, stood the gigantic face reproduced by Stephens, but
which has since disappeared. This head is so interesting that
I cannot deprive the reader of the description given by the
American traveller: “It is 7 feet 8 inches high. The features
were first rudely formed by small rough stones, fixed in the side
of the mound by means of mortar, and afterwards perfected
with stucco so hard that it has successfully resisted the action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">Pg 310</a></span>
of air and water for centuries.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> The stone forming the chin
alone measures 1 foot 6 inches; the figure has enormous moustachios,
and a resemblance may be traced to the gigantic faces in
stone at Copan, where the plaster has crumbled away and left the
stone bare. The resemblance to the Aké pyramids is remarkable
and leads us to conclude that the latter were decorated in the
same manner. Here also on the east side is found the figure
shown in our cut, from which may be traced the builder’s mode
of working.</p>

<p>This colossal head is 13 feet high; the eyes, nose, and
under-lip were first formed by rough stones coated over with
mortar; the ornaments to the right and left were obtained by
the same means; the latter are the best preserved, while double
spirals, symbols of wind or speech, may be seen, similar to
those in Mexico, at Palenque and Chichen-Itza. On the western
side of this pyramid, which has been cleared towards the basement,
we discovered one of the finest bas-reliefs it has been
our fortune to see in Yucatan. Its principal subject is a
crouching tiger with a human head and retreating forehead, less
exaggerated than those at Palenque, beautifully moulded, and
reminding us of the orders of knighthood in which the tiger
had the pre-eminence; nor could a better device be imagined
for the house of the commander-in-chief at Izamal. To conclude,
these documents, which would be a dead letter to one who had
not followed the various migrations from north to south, enable
us to reconstruct here also a Toltec centre. It may be noted
that if numerous monuments are still found in Yucatan, their
existence is due to the small number of Spaniards settled in these
regions at the time of the Conquest, and more especially to their
being at a distance from the centres occupied by the conquerors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">Pg 311</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-311.jpg" width="400" height="557" alt="COLOSSAL HEAD FORMING BASEMENT OF PYRAMID AT IZAMAL." />
<p class="caption">COLOSSAL HEAD FORMING BASEMENT OF PYRAMID AT IZAMAL.</p></div>

<p>Through the whole length and breadth of Anahuac both
monuments and cities have entirely disappeared; for the
Spaniards were not satisfied with destroying all that reminded
them of a former polity, they were also careful to infuse
into their young disciples a profound horror for their former
religion, while they trained children to report any word or
deed they observed in their parents or priests which savoured
of their ancient customs. Thanks to these measures, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">Pg 312</a></span>thing
that could recall the past to the rising generation was
soon blotted out from the Indian mind. But however dilapidated
the monuments we observe at Izamal, they prove that
there was here a great population at the time of the Conquest;
and this being admitted, it follows that their destruction
is comparatively recent, due mainly to civil wars, dating a
few years before the arrival of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>As for the Perez manuscript, which was written by a
native from memory long after the Conquest, purporting to
be the faithful rendering of legends handed down from mouth
to mouth, in a particular family, it adds nothing to our
knowledge, throws no light on the question which perplexes
us. The narrative begins from 144 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, and goes on to
1560 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>; but is it possible to admit seriously the authority
of an account so obtained, extending over so many centuries?
At the time of its publication all the natives had preserved
was a dubious legend; and traditions fared hardly better with
the caciques and nobles fallen from their high estate, than
they did with the common people, for “the former were often
reduced,” says Cogolludo, “to the extreme of poverty; and forty
years after the Conquest (1582) the royal descendants of
Tutulxiu, and the princely house of Mayapan, were obliged to
work for their living like the humblest amongst their ancient
subjects.”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p class="caption">MARKET PLACE OF IZAMAL.</p></div>

<p>This picture, sad as it is, became even worse a few years
later, when the conquerors had reduced the whole population
to a state of hard bondage. The only difference of any
importance between the Perez manuscript and the narratives
of Clavigero, Veytia, and Ixtlilxochitl, is in the chronology,
which is far too absurd for any serious consideration, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">Pg 313</a><br /><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">Pg 314</a><br /><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">Pg 315</a></span>while the latter gives the seventh century as the date of the
arrival of the Toltecs at Tula, and their subsequent migration
in Central America at the end of the eleventh and the
beginning of the twelfth century; with the former they leave
Tula in 144 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, and arrive in Yucatan in 217 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, nearly five
hundred years before the generally accepted date of their arrival
at Tula. Moreover he calls Yucatan an island, although the
new-comers had penetrated the country through Tabasco and
the south without crossing the sea, clearly indicating that it
was a peninsula.</p>

<p>The church of Izamal is very fine, but its chief attraction
in the eyes of the natives is a statue of the Virgin.
Its story runs thus:</p>

<p>A celebrated artist of Guatemala received an order from
the towns of Izamal and Merida respectively, for two
statues of the Virgin; in their transit, which took place in the
rainy season, neither the case containing the images, nor the
men conveying them, got a drop of rain. Valladolid, jealous
that so small a place as Izamal should possess this fine
statue, came in great force and carried it off, but the image
proved stronger than all those men put together, for it
became so heavy that it had to be abandoned at the outskirts
of the little town. The miracle was followed by a great
many more, so that the Izamal Virgin was soon the most
celebrated in the peninsula, attracting as many pilgrims as
did formerly <i>Kab-Ul</i>, of the Miraculous Hand.</p>

<p>We set off at five in the morning for Valladolid, to avoid
the overpowering heat of the day; indeed, all traffic
between May and September in these tropical regions is done
by night, for the greater comfort of both man and beast. We
watch the sun rise in the east, but far from enlivening
the scene, it seems only to bring out in stronger relief the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">Pg 316</a></span>
desolateness of the landscape. A few carts with natives on their
way home shivering with the night cold, a wretched tumbledown
hamlet called Stilipech, is all we notice on our route;
and indeed we have much to do with keeping our seats in
these <i>volan cochés</i>, which rattle along at so furious a pace
on these atrocious roads, as to make us wonder what power
keeps them from being smashed to pieces.</p>

<p>I had had suspicion during my stay at Merida as to
Yucatan having any postal or telegraphic administration, for
a number of my telegrams were left unanswered, and my
inquiries were met with the evasive reply that the line was
not in good order. That such was the case I could now
plainly see for myself. A wire which skirted the wood had
indeed been laid, but having no poles or insulators it trusted
to fate to get fixed now and again to a branch or a tree,
which, bending with the breeze, allowed it to trail among
the rocks or get entangled in the brambles. Wonderful to
relate, a message sometimes reached its destination; a great
step forward as compared to Tabasco, where no sooner is
the wire laid than it is purloined by the inhabitants, who, it
seems, find it useful. But our <i>volan</i> suddenly stops, and the
driver draws our attention to an important cenoté known as
Xcolac, shaded by beautiful trees and full of fish. On its
banks a number of Indians are filling their gourds to the
brim, and with simple grace offer us a drink of its cool,
fresh pure water. It argues strange apathy in the natives
that in a country where water is so scarce, a hamlet or
hacienda should not have been erected around it. We re-enter
our <i>cochés</i> and reach Tumbras, formerly a flourishing place,
about eleven o’clock; it was burnt down during the civil
wars and has not been rebuilt. We alight before a decent-looking
house, having a tienda stocked with salt, tobacco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">Pg 317</a></span>
wine, liqueurs, preserves, sardines, and American hams. For
whom are all these good things? I was going to ask, when
I recollected that a garrison is stationed here.</p>

<p>Our host, a fat, red-faced man, receives us with a profusion
of smiles, putting “everything in his house at our feet.” Warned
by sad experience, feeling, moreover, as hungry as schoolboys
after a game of cricket, we stammered out for the usual “portion”
in the shortest possible delay, but what was our agreeable surprise
to find a <i>menu</i> consisting of strong clear soup, a sardine
omelette, beefsteak, French beans, wine, English beer, and
excellent coffee!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-317.jpg" width="500" height="331" alt="CENOTÉ OF XCOLAC." />
<p class="caption">CENOTÉ OF XCOLAC.</p></div>

<p>Meanwhile the commander, who had received instructions
with regard to our mission, came in just as we were sitting down;
he was immediately invited to join our party, which he did with
alacrity, for the life of an officer quartered in this out-of-the-way
place, without a soul to speak to from year’s end to year’s end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">Pg 318</a></span>
whose sole business consists in the morning and evening parades,
or giving the order of the day, must be indescribably monotonous
and trying in the extreme.</p>

<p>The presence of our <i>volan</i> has set the village in motion; soon
a number of people are seen crossing the deserted plaza in our
direction: some are old and decrepit, and all look as though
they could hardly stand on their rickety legs, for the able-bodied
men are in the fields preparing the <i>milpa</i>, cleaning the ground for
the sowing of Indian corn. They invade the tienda, peering into
our room; the boldest advances with rolling gait, to have a nearer
view of our group, delivering himself of a little speech in the Maya
tongue, presumably indiscreet, to judge by the amused smiles of the
company. The commandant desires him to leave the room, but he
refuses, and has to be ejected by the united efforts of two orderlies.</p>

<p>Refreshed with our excellent luncheon, our pleasant chat, and
last, not least, a respite from the too lively <i>coché</i>, we set out, and
do not stop again until we reach Quintana-Roo, sometimes used
as a basis by the revolted natives in their expeditions, whence
they sallied forth for their <i>razzias</i>, carrying off the women, and
massacring the men, except in the rare instances when a large
ransom might be looked for; this, however, did not always save
the poor wretch, who, his money being paid, was ruthlessly
butchered by these savages.</p>

<p>Quintana is about as small a place as can be conceived, consisting
of one small fort garrisoned by twelve men, and one
house; in the landlord of the latter I recognise my old guide,
who in 1859 accompanied me to Chichen. My old acquaintance
is now a prosperous man, with a nice house, a tienda and poultry-yard
well stocked, while a comely wife, lovely children, and
pretty Meztizas, attend to the business of the household and
enliven it. My friend insists on our having some chocolate, and
wishes to be again our guide to Chichen. I am delighted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">Pg 319</a></span>
with expressions of mutual regard we take leave of this charming
family, <i>en route</i> for Citas, where we arrive so late in the evening
that everybody had given us up, so that nothing had been prepared,
and the people did not seem inclined to bestir themselves
for us. No house or room was to be had. It was fortunately
holiday time; the school-room was placed at our disposal, in
which we at once deposited our camp-beds and other paraphernalia.
The next thing was how to get something to eat,
and we should have gone supperless to bed, if the magistrate
and the mayor had not kindly interfered in our behalf, and
partly by coaxing, partly by the weight of their authority, induced
the people to bring out the contents of their larder.</p>

<p>Here we leave the <i>volan</i> for saddle-horses, mules, and
<i>tamenes</i>, for our next stage is through thick woods right
across country. Our preparations take a good deal of time;
horses are scarce and have to come some distance, while <i>tamenes</i>
must be brought down from their extravagant prices before
we can think of engaging them. The same difficulties have
beset us everywhere; the natives deeming fair game any one
so insane or ridiculous as to come from distant lands to view
some crumbling stones; of course he has more money than
he knows what to do with, and it is only common justice
to ease him of some of his surplus. We despatch our men a
day in advance to open the way through the woods, while we
tarry to witness a <i>jardana</i>, native dance, to which an invitation
in due form, that we “would honour the same with our presence,”
has been received.</p>

<p>“What, you dance here?” I exclaimed on first hearing of
it; “but you told me that your life and property were continually
threatened; that you never knew when you lay down at night
whether you would not be massacred by your revolted countrymen,
ere another day dawned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">Pg 320</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s quite true,” answered my servant, “but we dance
for all that, and as often as we have the opportunity. Why
should we neglect to cull the few flowerets growing on the short,
dreary path of our life?”</p>

<p>I confess that I was not prepared for so much philosophy
in such a place, and from such a man, savouring of a <i>ci-devant</i>
at the time of the Convention rather than of a half-savage.</p>

<p>The streets of Citas might not improperly be called ridges
of rock divided by minute precipices, down which, however, a
stranger may break his neck. To avoid so great a calamity,
we set out holding on to two native guides by means of ropes
tied round our waist, for the night is pitch dark, and the distance
to the <i>jardana</i> some 500 yards.</p>

<p>The house in which the entertainment is given wears a
poor appearance. Three huge fires are burning, round which
stand women busy with roasting and otherwise preparing the
feast with chickens, turkeys, pork, etc.; whilst outside, other
women are kneeling before <i>metates</i>, or, <i>comals</i> in hand, prepare
tortillas to be served hot during the whole “fiesta.” A little
in front is a thatched barn, lighted by smoking lamps, which forms
the ball-room, with benches and chairs against the walls for the
ladies, while in the centre the men dancers in white hose, flowing
shirt, and loose coloured neckties, are meditating on whom their
choice may fall with any chance of success. The whole village,
Indians and Meztizos, are here to-night, but hardly any <i>Ladinos</i>
or whites.</p>

<p>Every traveller who has witnessed these native dances, has
described them as entrancing; for my part I confess that I find
them devoid of attraction: the performers, without grace or
animation, move gravely on one spot, without looking at or touching
their partners, going round them as they would a pole, to the
sound of very primitive and monotonous music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">Pg 321</a></span></p>

<p>“It is an Indian who gives the entertainment,” said my friend
the judge. “It will last several days, or rather several nights,
and cost at least sixty pounds, which to a native is a fortune—ruination
in fact—but he will not care, and after him another will be
found to take up the ball, and so on to the end of time.”</p>

<p>“But what happens afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing happens; they’ll go to their <i>milpas</i> as before;
if the harvest is good they will lay by a little in view of another
party when their turn comes round; if it is a bad year, they’ll
pinch; if a famine, they’ll starve. Care never sits behind an
Indian, and as for the lessons of experience, they seem incapable
of learning them.”</p>

<p>In these entertainments may be traced the customs of the
ancient Indians which are unconsciously kept up by their
descendants. We read in Landa: “They often spent in one
banquet what they had been a long time earning with difficulty.
Banquets were of two kinds: those given by the caciques and
great nobles to their friends for the mere pleasure of showing
their hospitality, when they expected to be asked in return. The
table on all such occasions was well provided with meats, game,
vegetables, and fruit of every kind, and at the conclusion of
the entertainment, the guests were presented with rich dresses
and ornaments, when they withdrew after midnight.” “If one
died before the debt of his obligation had been paid, the duty
fell to his family. Next came the occasions when a marriage
occurred in a family, or when the illustrious deeds of an ancestor
were celebrated by the whole clan. On such occasions the
necessity of returning the banquet was not enforced; but if a
person belonging to another family had been asked, he was
expected to invite them all again when he married.”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">Pg 322</a></span></p>

<p>There is positively nothing worthy of remark with regard
to our road, save here and there a palm or cedar-tree towering
like a giant over the thick underwood overrun with flowering
lianas, peopled with great sky-blue butterflies, whose wings
are tipped with black; for the whole country to the east and
south of Citas is a vast scene of desolation. Pisté, where we
arrive, stands on the extreme border of the state; it has been
so often sacked and burnt by the revolted natives, that the
only building left is the church, occupied by a company of twenty-five
men. It looks a forsaken, God-forgotten place, a veritable
exile for the small garrison quartered here in turn for three
months in the year; not that there is any immediate danger,
for the natives, who first rose to conquer their liberties, fell
to massacring from a spirit of revenge, and now only take the
field for the sake of plunder. We have nothing to tempt their
cupidity, consequently our escort of fifty men is a measure of
prudence rather than of necessity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ruins of Chichen are two miles east of Pisté, and were used
as pasture for the cattle of the inhabitants, who at stated periods
had the woods cut down, when the monuments were easily
distinguished. It was a favourite place, to the prejudice of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">Pg 324</a></span>
palaces and the sculptures, which were made the butt by the
visitors to shoot at; but since the destruction of Pisté, nature
again reigns supreme; every sign of the buildings has disappeared,
and the jungle has become so impassable, that twenty
men were required to open the old path.</p>

<p>This was not my first visit to Chichen, nevertheless my
emotion was profound on beholding again the gigantic outline of
El Castillo, which we had decided beforehand should be our headquarters,
as from its elevated position it offered many strategical
advantages, which would secure us against surprise. It was
with considerable difficulty that we climbed the steps, which are
steep and completely invaded by a vigorous vegetation; as for
our great quantity of baggage, none but nimble, sure-footed
natives could have succeeded in hauling it up on to the platform
of the monument.</p>

<p>Our next thought was how to dispose of ourselves. The
interior of El Castillo consists of a rectangular corridor, running
along two-thirds of the edifice, pierced east, south, and west by
three large apertures, and a gallery giving access to a great hall
closed in on every side. We very stupidly gave up the latter
to our men, with the idea that we should be cooler and have
more air in the open gallery, not taking into consideration that
at this altitude, whichever way the wind blew, it would sweep
in upon us in fearful blasts, causing perpetual sneezing, coughing,
and freezing the very life out of us.</p>

<p>The day was spent unpacking and classifying, and at suppertime
we discovered that our cook, who was to have come from
Valladolid, had failed us; food we had in tins, but no water,
having left our cantaros at Citas, so that we were obliged to
go without soup, coffee, or our evening tub.</p>

<p>It may seem unworthy to have been put out by such
trivial details with the grand spectacle we had before us: a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">Pg 325</a></span>
glorious moon had risen, sailing on her course with her brilliant
retinue of scintillating stars, illuminating the vast wooded expanse,
like a boundless, heaving ocean on a calm day; fragments
of walls, mounds, eminences, shrouded in a sombre vegetation,
were distinctly visible, which I pointed out one by one to
my companions who, unlike myself, beheld them for the first
time. El Castillo occupies nearly the centre of the ruins;
below it to the east was the Market-place, and two small
palaces which belonged to it; to the north, a stately but
ruinous building, the cenoté and the temple attached; to the
north-west, the famous Tennis-court; to the west and south-west,
the Chichan-Chob, the Caracol and the other cenoté, the
Nuns’ Palace, the Akab-Sib; and farther south, the hacienda,
which has long been abandoned.</p>

<p>We were conversing in subdued tones of the mysterious
past of this dead city, which mayhap our studies and explorations
would bring to life again; all was hushed, and the
death-like silence was only broken at regular intervals by the
cry of our sentinels; and these very cries carried us back to
the far-gone days, when the city was perhaps similarly guarded
against a sudden inroad from her jealous neighbours.</p>

<p>The morning effects of light and shade were no less
beautiful; the broad level wrapped in a transparent mist,
pierced here and there by the pyramids and the wooded
eminences, looked like a whitening sea interspersed with green
islets; while the horizon was gilded with the brightness of
the rising sun, who seemed to create, to raise suddenly into
life all the objects touched with his golden wand; presently,
like a mighty giant he tore asunder and burnt up the white
vapour, and lit up the whole sky.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our unpacking and our plans for the immediate
future are almost completed; the cantaros have come, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">Pg 326</a></span>
water is one of our great requirements, as the cenoté is at some
distance, and there are ninety steps to our abode, ten men
are told off for it; other ten are set to cleaning the place,
while an equal number will open up the paths and clear the
monuments we wish to explore.</p>

<p>Here it may be remarked that Yucatan had centres rather
than cities; for the groups of dwellings and palaces we find
resemble in no way our cities of the present day, although
they are continually compared to Spanish places, notably Sevilla,
by the conquerors. They consist everywhere of temples and
palaces, either of the reigning prince or caciques, of public
edifices scattered about, apparently at random, covering a vast
area, with cemented roads and gardens intervening, while the
avenues were occupied by the dwellings of dependents and
slaves. This is borne out by Landa, who says: “Before the
arrival of the Spaniards the aborigines lived in common, were
ruled by severe laws, and the lands were cultivated and planted
with useful trees. The centre of their towns was occupied by
the temples and squares, round which were grouped the palaces
of the lords and the priests, and so on in successive order to
the outskirts, which were allotted to the lower classes. The
wells, necessarily few, were found close to the dwellings of
the nobles, who lived in close community for fear of their
enemies, and not <i>until the time of the Spaniards</i> did they
take to the woods.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>These last words plainly indicate the sudden desertion of
Indian cities at the coming of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>The word used by Landa is <i>pueblo</i>, “hamlet,” meaning,
perhaps, town; at all events, it shows that even after the
breaking up of the Maya empire (from great provinces) into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">Pg 327</a></span>small independent principalities, the people had preserved their
ancient customs. Chichen-Itza, “the mouth of the wells,” from
the two cenotés around which the town was built, is more recent
than Izamal or Aké, but older than Uxmal, although it belongs,
like the latter, to the “cut stone period.”</p>

<p>Our information respecting it is of the vaguest, and Aguilar
and Montejo are equally silent on the subject, while E. Ancona
is of opinion that the greater portion of the writings and
documents treating of the conquest of Yucatan have been
lost, or at any rate have escaped our investigations. Nevertheless,
we find in a letter of Montejo to the King of Spain,
April 13th, 1529, published by Brinton, of Philadelphia, from
the unpublished documents and archives of the Indies, this
remarkable passage: “This region is covered with great and
beautiful cities and a dense population” (“ciudades muy frescas,”
recent, new). Could he have expressed more clearly that
the cities he had visited were lately built? Can these places
have disappeared and left no trace? Who were the builders
of the noble ruins that have filled with admiration every
one who has visited them?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, whether we consult the traditions collected too
late, or the Perez manuscript with its doubtful dates, we find no
certain data to go upon; in the latter we read that the Toltecs
travelled in 360 from Bacalar (Ziyancan) to Chichen; left it in
452 to return in 888, when they remained until 936; that a
governor of Chichen was defeated in 1258 by a prince of
Mayapan, etc.; in fact, a mere roll of obscure names without any
meaning. If we would find an ascertained historical fact, we
must turn to Cogolludo and Landa, who wrote from 1420 to 1460,
where the Chichemec exodus is recorded, corresponding to the
capture and destruction of Mayapan.</p>

<p>The cause of this emigration (or elopement, since there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">Pg 328</a></span>
a lady in the case) is thus told by Cogolludo: “A king of
Chichen, called Canek (a generic name of the sovereigns of the
Iztaes), fell desperately in love with a young princess, who,
whether she did not return his affection, or whether she was
obliged to obey a parent’s mandate, married a more powerful
Yucatec cacique. The discarded lover, unable to bear his loss,
moved by love and despair, armed his dependents and suddenly
fell upon his successful rival; when the gaiety of the feast was
exchanged for the din of war, and amidst the confusion the
Chichen prince disappeared, carrying off the beautiful bride. But
conscious that his power was less than his rival’s, and fearing
his vengeance, he fled the country with most of his vassals.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>Thus runs the legend; the historical fact is that the inhabitants
of Chichen did emigrate, and did establish in the Peten
lagoons, one hundred leagues to the south, a little principality with
Tayasal for its capital, seen by Cortez in his journey to Honduras,
and brought under the Spanish sway as late as 1696. That a
whole population should abandon their native city, is an example
of the facility with which these peoples moved from one place
to another at a moment’s notice; nevertheless, we cannot accept
the reasons given by Cogolludo for this migration, so little in
accordance with the deep-seated love of the Mayas for their
country. It is more likely that one or a series of calamities
incident to a primitive race, such as war, pestilence, famine, more
or less periodical among the aborigines, was the true cause of
their migration.</p>

<p>One thing is clear, that Chichen was inhabited scarcely sixty
years before the Conquest, when her monuments were entire;
and it is equally clear that a city possessed of two considerable
cenotés, so important in a country without water, was not left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">Pg 329</a></span>uninhabited, and that the vacuum left by the exodus was soon
filled up, the city preserving its normal existence down to the
time of the Spaniards. I am well aware that this kind of evidence
will not suit people fond of the marvellous, yet the paucity of
documents allows us only a tentative theory, but it will be our
care to collect probabilities in such vast numbers, knitting them
into a cumulative whole by a patient comparison of monuments,
sculptures, bas-reliefs, customs, arms, and public ceremonies, so
as to make the evidence absolute. Had Aguilar, who was
wrecked and made prisoner on this coast, and lived for nearly
eight years as factotum of a powerful cacique, been more
observant, we might have a graphic and thorough description of
the public and private life among the Mayas; but like the rest
of his countrymen, his ideas were turned into quite a different
channel, so much so that he has not even recorded the name
of the place where later Cortez found him. Ancona tells us
that the conquest of Yucatan was hastened by Aguilar, who,
when in Mexico with Cortez, persuaded Montejo that “the
region was fertile and covered with magnificent monuments”—words
of paramount importance, since Aguilar could not have
mentioned them in such terms, had they been in ruins or hid
away in the woods. It may also be inferred from the incessant
mutual warfare of the caciques, that the country had lost its unity
and was split up into several provinces, which Herrera says were
“eighteen in number covered with stately edifices.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> According
to the same authority Montejo had a return of the whole population
taken, that he might apportion them among his followers,
when every one received no less than two or three thousand.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>
This, however, is obviously a gross exaggeration, for supposing
the 400 soldiers of Montejo to have dwindled down to 300,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">Pg 330</a></span>the mean population of the district would have amounted to
750,000, which is quite impossible.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> At all events, the Spaniards
occupied Chichen-Itza for two years, but nothing is known of
their doings, for Montejo was no writer, nor did he, like Cortez,
have chroniclers to record his deeds. At first the submission
of the natives was complete; but after a time they rallied from
the stupor into which the unparalleled success of the Spaniards
had plunged them, and tiring of ministering to the insatiable wants
of the Spanish marauders, who consumed in one day what would
have kept in comfort a native family for a month, they disappeared,
and the Spaniards were soon reduced to foraging in distant
villages. This gave rise to daily skirmishes and a more active
hatred on the part of the Indians against the foreigners, until
at last exasperated, relying moreover on their numerical strength,
they came in great numbers and laid siege to Chichen, during
which the Spaniards lost 150 of their number, while the rest
were all covered with wounds. In this strait, Montejo, despairing
of holding the place much longer, determined to evacuate it; this
it was not easy to do, for the whole country round was occupied
by the Indians; but a pitch-dark night seemed to favour their
flight: Montejo took the precaution of having the horses’ hoofs
muffled, not to arouse the natives’ suspicions respecting their movements,
while he left a dog tied to a pole beneath a piece of meat
with a bell attached, which the animal rang every time he tried
to reach the prey, thus keeping the Indians in the full belief
that the enemy was entrenched behind the walls. Only on the
morrow did the natives find out their mistake; they gave instant
but unavailing pursuit, for the Spaniards had several hours’ start
of them and were able to reach the territory of a friendly cacique,
not far from their own ships.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">Pg 331</a></span></p>
<p>To return to our excavations, “El Palacio de las Monjas,”
or Nuns’ Palace, is one of the most important monuments at
Chichen-Itza, and possesses a greater number of apartments
than any other. Whether the name is due to this circumstance,
or from its traditionary appellation, is uncertain; but
we know from Mexican writers that it was the custom
among the Aztecs to dedicate girls of noble birth to the
service of the gods, on their attaining the age of twelve or
thirteen. Some remained there until they were about to be
married; some few took perpetual vows; others, on account
of some vow they had made during sickness, or that the gods
might send them a good husband, entered the Nunnery for
one, two, three, or four years. They were called deaconesses
or sisters; they lived under the superintendence of staid
matrons of good character, and upon entering the convent,
each girl had her hair cut short. They all slept in one
dormitory, and were not allowed to undress before retiring to
rest, that they might always be ready when the signal was
given to rise. They occupied their time with weaving and
embroidering the tapestry and ornamental work of the temple.
They rose in the night to renew the incense in the braziers,
a matron leading the procession; the maidens with eyes
modestly cast down filed up to the altar, and returned in
the same manner; they fasted often, and were required to
sweep the temples and keep a constant supply of fresh
flowers on the altars. They did penance for the slightest
infringement of their religious rules by pricking their tongues
and ears with the spines of the maguey plant. Death was the
punishment of the Mexican maiden who violated her vow of
chastity.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">Pg 332</a></span></p>
<p>It has been supposed, from the latter custom, that an order
of Vestals, similar to those in Rome, existed in America, but
the analogy is more apparent than real. According to Clavigero,
priesthood was not binding for life among the Mayas. Of
the different male and female religious orders, those dedicated
to Quetzalcoatl deserve particular mention; their members had
to submit to the strictest observances, but in compensation
the people paid them almost divine honours, whilst their
power and influence were boundless. Their chief or superior
bore the name of Quetzalcoatl, and never walked abroad
except to visit some royal personage.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Thus the Nunnery
may very well have been both a convent and a priestly
abode. It is not a considerable pile, the façade measuring
only some 29 feet by 19 feet 6 inches high, while its
grotesque, heavy ornamentation reminds us in its details
of a Chinese carving. The base up to the first cornice
is occupied by eight large superimposed idols, and four
of these figures are enclosed within two very salient cornices.
The door is crowned with a medallion representing a cacique
or priest with the usual head-dress of feathers, the inscription
of the palace and stone spires, some of which have
entirely disappeared, while the outline of the rest is much
defaced. The whole length of the frieze of the north façade
has a row of similar gigantic heads, bearing the general
characteristics of the ornamentation observable throughout this
structure. The Nunnery is typical of the Toltec calli, of which
we gave a drawing in our chapter on Tula. The left wing is
but 26 feet wide, by 13 feet deep, and about 32 feet high; it consists
of three cornices, with two friezes intervening in which the
same designs are repeated; the first two high-reliefs represent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">Pg 333</a></span>stooping figures, one having his body locked in a tortoise shell,
while the centre and the sides of the frieze are decorated with
grotesque figures like those of the main façade, which, with
small variations, are the same throughout the peninsula. As
we have seen in a former chapter, these monstrous masks have
been called elephants by Waldeck and others, who wished to
claim a fabulous antiquity for these monuments, but the types
they most resemble are the Japanese or Chinese. Here, as at
Palenque, the upper portion of the wall is ornamented so as
to enhance the effect of height.</p>

<p>The main body of the Nunnery rests on a perpendicular
pyramid, the platform of which is occupied by a solidly constructed
building, intersected with small apartments having two
niches facing each other, traversed by a corridor running from
east to west of the pyramid. Over this is a smaller structure
or third story. The first platform is reached by a steep, broad
stairway 50 feet wide, which continues with additional steps to
the second platform, where the apartments of the ruined building
were but cells. The ornamentation of the first story differs
from that of other buildings at Chichen; it consists of small
sunk panels, having in the centre a large rose-like device, framed
with exquisitely moulded stones. The lintels, likewise of stone,
were covered with sculptures and inscriptions now fallen into
decay; we could only collect three, and even these are much
defaced. In this building are curious traces of masonry out of
character with the general structure, showing the place to have
been occupied at two different epochs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">ORNAMENTATION OF THE UPPER STORY OF THE NUNNERY, CHICHEN-ITZA.</p></div>

<p>This second construction, or rather restoration, was effected
with the materials of the ancient building, as is seen in the
fragments of sculptured stones which in the later construction
are identical with those of the first, save that they were put
up haphazard, so that the systematic ornamentation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">Pg 334</a></span>
older structure is no longer reproduced, but in places a thick
plaster coating was laid over the whole. The rebuilding may
have been the work of the aborigines, since we know that
Chichen was abandoned and reoccupied towards the middle
of the fifteenth century; or, more likely still, the clumsy restoration
may have been the work of the Spaniards during their
sojourn in the city, when the Nunnery, from its elevated position,
constituted a valuable fortress. Traces of their passage are
observable in various other buildings, notably in the Castillo,
where their natural fanaticism, coupled with their ignorance,
caused them to see in the portraiture of the national and religious
life of the Mayas, representations of the devil. This could
not be suffered to remain, and as they were unable to demolish
the temples and palaces in which they lived, they whitewashed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">Pg 335</a><br /><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">Pg 336</a><br /><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">Pg 337</a></span>the ornamentation, in order that their eyes might not be
constantly offended by the subjects therein represented.</p>

<p class="caption">MAIN FAÇADE OF THE NUNNERY OF CHICHEN-ITZA.</p></div>

<p>We try with small success to undo their savage work by
means of daggers, brushes, and repeated washes, taking up
much time, but in most cases the relief is lost to science,
being much too defaced to allow us to take squeezes. The
idea that the chiefs who erected these monuments were the
authors of their defacement is too absurd for serious consideration.</p>

<p>The Castillo, or rather temple,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> is reared on a pyramid,
facing north and south, and is the most interesting monument
at Chichen; its four sides are occupied with staircases, facing
the cardinal points. Our drawing shows the western façade.
The base of the pyramid measures 175 feet; it consists of
nine small esplanades, narrowing towards the top, supported
by perpendicular walls, and terminates in a structure about
39 feet on one side by 21 feet high. The upper platform is
68 feet above the level of the plain, having a flight of ninety
steps, 39 feet wide, leading up to it.</p>

<p>The name of El Castillo (the fortress), given to this building
is appropriate enough; since throughout Central America,
temples, in times of war, became real strongholds, on whose
gigantic terraces the last desperate conflict was waged against
an invading and victorious foe. The struggle might last some
time, but was always attended with heavy loss, for each
terrace had to be carried against men resolved to die. In
the assault on the great temple in Mexico, the Spaniards were
several times repulsed before they could get possession of the
four esplanades of the pyramid; and when these were taken
a fierce encounter followed on the upper platform, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">Pg 338</a></span>only ended with the utter annihilation of the Aztecs, who were
either slaughtered on the spot or hurled down the sides of
the pyramid.</p>

<p class="caption">NORTHERN FAÇADE OF THE NUNNERY OF CHICHEN-ITZA.</p></div>

<p>The only decoration of the western and southern sides
consists in two beautiful cornices, while the interior of the long
corridor shows no trace of ornamentation, save over the doors,
where gigantic warriors are sculptured. The principal or
northern façade must have been very striking when Landa saw
it in 1560. Our photograph shows its dilapidated condition, but
it can easily be reconstructed. It consists of a portico supported
by two massive columns connected by wooden lintels, resembling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">Pg 339</a><br /><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">Pg 340</a><br /><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">Pg 341</a></span>that in the Nunnery; this portico gives access to a gallery which
occupies the whole width of the building. A large room, which
must have been the sanctuary, is entered by the only opening
out of the gallery, while two pillars with square capitals supported
a double corbel vault. Here the stairway was wider, and on
each side, forming a balustrade, is a gigantic plumed serpent,
whose head and protruding tongue run down the balustrade. All
these columns, pillars, and wooden lintels, are covered with
sculptures and bas-reliefs, the impressions of which kept us closely
at work for several days.</p>

<p>As in Mexico, Palenque, and Tula, there were no doors
properly so called at Chichen, and no traces of hinges are found;
but a bamboo or wickerwork screen was suspended across the
entrance, and secured at night with a bar. The inner rooms
were divided off by hangings, which probably also served to
cover the windows. We notice everywhere the small holes in
the pillars into which the bars fitted.</p>

<p>Landa mentions the two serpents of the grand staircase, and
that the corridor was probably used for burning perfumes:
“Over the door is a kind of coat-of-arms sculptured in stone,
which I could not read. Extending round this edifice is a
series of solid constructions; the intervening distances are
coated with cement in perfect condition, <i>which looks quite new</i>,
so hard was the mortar in which it was laid.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> These stucco
layers are facsimiles of those at Tula and Teotihuacan, and
characteristic of the Toltecs. In the three centuries that
have elapsed since the bishop visited these monuments, vegetation
has completely over-run them, but it was not so in his
time.</p>

<p>It was in this temple that the striking analogy between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">Pg 342</a></span>sculptures and the bas-reliefs of the plateaux with those at
Chichen was first revealed to us; and since the dates of the
Toltec emigrations are known, we can fix approximately the age
of these monuments. We know, on the other hand, that the
Aztec civilisation was but a reflex directly derived from the
Toltecs, so that in some of their manifestations the two civilisa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">Pg 343</a></span>tions
must resemble each other; from all which it may be seen
that these monuments are both Toltec and recent. The
balustrade on the grand staircase consists of a plumed serpent
like those forming the outer wall of the temple in Mexico; an
emblem of Quetzalcoatl, a deity common to the Toltecs, the
Aztecs, and the Mayas. He is often found on Yucatec buildings.
In Mexico, a serpent biting his tail was a favourite design with
the Aztecs as a frieze to their houses, or over their entrances,
and this we shall also observe at Uxmal. Further, the two
columns of the temple façade furnish a still more striking
example: the bases represent two serpents’ heads, whilst the
shafts were ornamented with feathers, proving that the temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">Pg 344</a></span>
was dedicated to Cukulcan (Quetzalcoatl). These shafts are
almost an exact reproduction of a Toltec column we unearthed
at Tula, as seen in our cuts. The two columns are
found three hundred leagues from each other, separated by an
interval of several centuries; but if, as we firmly believe, the
Tula column is Toltec, the other must be so too, for it could
not be the result of mere accident. I have only compared the
shafts, for the simple reason that the Tula column has no capital.</p>

<p>The bas-relief on
the capital of the other
<span class="figleft300" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-344.jpg" width="300" height="318" alt="YUCATEC CAPITAL AT CHICHEN-ITZA." />
<span class="caption">YUCATEC CAPITAL AT CHICHEN-ITZA.</span></span>
consists of a standing
figure with upraised
arms supporting the
entablature; he wears
large bracelets, huge
feathers form his headdress,
his feet are
covered with shoes fastened
on the instep by
a leather knot, a collar
of precious stones is
around his neck, a
richly embroidered
maxtli falls to the ground, and he wears the long flowing beard
characteristic of Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<p>The two bas-reliefs given opposite are from pillars in
the sanctuary. They represent figures in gala costumes,
one of which is distinguished by a long beard, and all have
the aquiline nose ascribed to the Toltecs. These pillars are
occupied by three bas-reliefs, a large one in the centre and
two smaller at each side of it. The central relief is a life-size
figure of a priest, to judge from the total absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">Pg 345</a></span>
arms about all the figures on these pillars. The caryatides
on the smaller reliefs, notably the lower one, have double
spirals over the mouth, presumably a symbol of wind and
speech. We noticed in a former chapter this spiral about
Quetzalcoatl on the outer relief of the altar in the Temple
of the Cross at Palenque. All these caryatides represent
<span class="figright300" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-345.jpg" width="300" height="414" alt="DOOR-POSTS IN THE CASTILLO, CHICHEN-ITZA." />
<span class="caption">DOOR-POSTS IN THE CASTILLO, CHICHEN-ITZA.</span></span>
long-bearded men,
whose type is identical
with those on the
Tula relief, as may
be seen by the most
superficial comparison
of the two. But is
the spiral an emblem
of speech? That it is
so may be assumed
from the upper caryatid,
which only supporting
the entablature
has no spiral about
the mouth, while the
lower one not only
bears aloft the central
figure and the edifice,
but it seems to carry,
to create and breathe life into the whole, as the emblem of
civilisation. At least so it struck us when we looked at these
bearded figures which support the pillars, and saw the symbolical
sign of quickening speech around the mouth of each, and
considered that the Toltecs were the builders of these monuments,
which they reared by their mighty word, in accordance with
their pacific and civilising character, as described by Herrera and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">Pg 346</a></span>
Landa. I am well aware that this assumption rests on no
scientific basis, nevertheless I hope to bring so many data in
its favour as to make it highly probable. The most remarkable
feature about the relief on the capital is its striking resemblance
to the caryatides in high relief found on the terrace and façade
of Angcor-Thom’s palace, given by Francis Garnier;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> in both
the same attitude and dress are observable; the latter consists
of the <i>patoi</i> with the Cambodians, and the maxtli with the
Toltecs; while the sculpture is primitive in both, the only
difference being in the relief.</p>

<p>Our excursions in these impenetrable woods, our ascents
and descents of the pyramid, the arduous work attending the
taking of squeezes, made our life very harassing; it could have
been more easily borne had we been able to sleep, but the
scorching days were succeeded by icy-cold nights, which kept
us awake, so that we rose in the morning more unrefreshed
and more tired than when we turned in for the night.</p>

<p>Some compensation we had in our walks round the pyramid,
beguiling the time we could not sleep with a cigar, contemplating
the fine starry nights and sometimes the lunar rainbows so rarely
seen; or we watched the broad shadow of the pyramid cast
athwart the white haze shrouding the plain, fringed by an immense
brilliant corona, which seemed to float in space. Never
had I gazed on anything so curious and fantastic as this
terrestrial halo; and if the ancient worshippers of Cukulcan
ever witnessed the phenomenon, they must have deemed it
little short of miraculous.</p>

<p>We were still without a cook; for Julian was so atrociously
bad that I kept him at the squeezes, taking the cooking
ourselves in turn, which wasted much valuable time. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">Pg 347</a></span>evening, after everybody had gone to

rest, I was sitting alone writing my
impressions, my head full of the ruins
and the people who inhabited them.
I suddenly looked up, to see standing
before me a lovely maiden more
like an apparition than a mortal
being. Was this the shade of a
Maya princess who had returned to
the scenes of her former life, conjured
up by my imagination? Meanwhile
the beauteous figure stood
looking and smiling at me. I was
amazed, speechless, hardly daring to
break the spell, when a third figure
stood out from the dark entrance, in
whom I recognised the commandant
of Pisté.</p>

<p>“You are surprised at our visit,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Rather, especially at this hour,
and in such a night.”</p>

<p>“Time is of no account when you
wish to serve a friend; I heard that
you required a cook, I brought you
mine, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“A cook!” I ejaculated to myself.
What a fall! my Indian princess
a cook! I looked at her again, and
I could not believe that so much
youth and beauty were put to such
menial occupation. I wondered at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">Pg 348</a></span>
the commandant’s self-abnegation. I was somewhat embarrassed,
nevertheless, as to where I should put her. I called
up Julian to prepare a bed for her, but as he was not easily
roused, I had time to reflect that with a hundred men about
me, El Castillo was no fitting place for a young girl. I
was profuse in my acknowledgments to the commandant,
observing that as nothing was ready, it would perhaps be
better to put off her coming for a day or two, apologising
for the trouble they had taken in coming through the woods
and having to climb the pyramid in such a pitch-dark night.
He knew what I meant. I slipped a coin in the girl’s
hand, as she held a bottle towards me. “Drink,” said the
officer; “it is Josepha’s present to you.” I did so, while
Josepha merely put her lips to the bottle. We shook hands,
and my two visitors disappeared in the night. The draught
was <i>Staventum</i>, a strong spirit, which made me light-headed,
and in a fit of somnambulism I wandered about, spouting poetry
at the top of my voice, on the very edge of the pyramid, whence
I was fortunately removed, without any further result than to
awake the next day with a splitting headache. Our long-expected
cook arrived at last, and she was so old, and such a fright, that
it relieved me of all fear on her account.</p>

<p>Akab-Sib, “writing in the dark,” is a modern appellation,
due to a bas-relief found on the lintel of an inner door at
the extremity of the building. The cut we give is a copy of
our photograph. We can give no explanation respecting this
relief. The figure it represents is sitting before a vase full of
indistinct objects, with outstretched arm and forefinger pointed,
whether in question or command is uncertain—not much for the
imagination to go upon. We will restrict ourselves to pointing
out the analogy of the characters in the inscriptions with those
at Palenque. The structure consists of eighteen rooms, reared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">Pg 349</a></span>
on a plain pyramid, with a stairway to the east, without any
ornamentation.</p>

<p>The Caracol is a round building, 22 feet in diameter, with
a double inner corridor and a central pillar; it is a kind of
tower, used probably for civil or religious ceremonies, for we
have found this kind of structure at Cozumel and in all the
great centres.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus-349.jpg" width="350" height="349" alt="BAS-RELIEFS WITH INSCRIPTIONS, AKAB-SIB PALACE AT CHICHEN-ITZA." />
<p class="caption">BAS-RELIEFS WITH INSCRIPTIONS, AKAB-SIB PALACE AT CHICHEN-ITZA.</p></div>

<p>The Chichan-Chob, “Red House” (p. 351), is a small
building about a hundred yards north of the Caracol; it
stands on a rectangular platform, reached by a flight of
twelve or fifteen steps. It is the best preserved monument
at Chichen, and might be even now a pleasant residence; for
time seems to have respected and to have left untouched its
plain, smooth walls, and from its general appearance it cannot
date further back than towards the last years of the city in the
fifteenth century. Three doorways to the north lead into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">Pg 350</a></span>
corridor extending over the whole length of the building, whence
three more openings give access to as many apartments in a
perfect state of preservation. Over these doorways, and running
the whole length of the corridor, is a narrow stone tablet, on
which is graven a row of hieroglyphics very much damaged, of
which Stephens gave a faithful reproduction.</p>

<p>The situation of Chichen is due probably to the great cenotés
which supplied the city with abundant water, and which differ
from the complicated underground passages noted in other parts
of the state, being immense natural pits of great depth, with
perpendicular sides. Of these cenotés, that for general use
occupied the centre of the place; picturesque must have been
the throng of white-robed women who peopled its steps at all
hours of the day to fetch water for household purposes, carrying
double-handled urns on their shoulders or on their hips just
as they do at the present day. The other, or sacred cenoté, lies
in a tangle of wood on the confines of the city, to which a path
had to be opened. We find midway a large broken statue of
Tlaloc, similar to the two we reproduce further on; the upper
portion of the body and the head are wanting. Near it are
ruinous heaps, remains of two temples, their base occupied by
immense heads of Quetzalcoatl, who seems to have been the
tutelary deity of Chichen. On fragments of walls still standing,
I notice bas-reliefs in excellent preservation, one representing a
large fish with a human head,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> and the other a figure of a man
after death.</p>

<p class="caption">CHICHAN-CHOB, PRISON OF CHICHEN-ITZA.</p></div>

<p>Landa’s description of these temples would lead us to infer
that they were entire in his time, for he says: “Some distance
north of the Castillo were two small theatres built with square
blocks; four flights of steps led to the top, paved with fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">Pg 351</a><br /><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">Pg 352</a><br /><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">Pg 353</a></span>slabs, and on which low comedies were performed.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Notwithstanding
Landa and Cogolludo’s testimony, we think they
were temples on whose summits the Christianised Indians performed
their religious ceremonies, which from fear of anathemas
they represented to the good bishop as comedies.</p>

<p>The sacred cenoté lies 150 yards beyond; it is oblong in
shape, and the two diameters measure from 130 to 165 feet.
The surface of the water cannot be reached, for the wall, some
65 feet high, is entire and perpendicular throughout. The desolation
of this <i>aguado</i>, its walls shrouded with brambles, shrubs,
and lianas, the sombre forest beyond, but above all the lugubrious
associations attaching to it, fill the imagination with indescribable
melancholy.</p>

<p>Hither pilgrims repaired, and here offerings were made; for
Chichen was a holy city, and among her shrines the cenoté
held a conspicuous place, as the following passage from Landa
will show: “From the courtyard of the theatre, a good wide
road led to a well some little distance beyond (the road was
therefore in perfectly good condition), into which in times of
drought the natives used to throw men, <i>as indeed they still
do</i> (1560), as an offering to their deities, fully believing that
they would not die, even though they disappeared. Precious
stones and other valuable objects were also offered; and had
the country been rich in gold, this well would contain a vast
quantity, because of the great veneration of the natives for it.
The aguado is round, of great depth, measuring over 100 feet
in width and cunningly hewn out of the rock.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> The green
colour of the water is due to the foliage; on its banks rises
a small building filled with idols in honour of all the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">Pg 354</a></span>edifices in the country, exactly like the Pantheon in Rome. I
cannot say whether this is an ancient practice or an innovation
of the aborigines, who find here their idols to which they can
bring their offerings. I also found sculptured lions, vases, and
other objects, which, from the manner they were fashioned,
must have been wrought with metal instruments; besides two
statues of considerable size of one single block, with peculiar
heads, earrings, and the maxtli round their loins.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> This passage
is very remarkable, but the Abbé Brasseur, who translated
it, does not seem to have grasped its true meaning. What,
there was a plastered road in good preservation, a temple filled
with idols brought thither by the existing natives, more than forty
years after the Conquest, there were numerous offerings in honour
of the various poliote deities, statues representing the Mayas in
their national costume, and yet it is urged that these temples
were constructed before the Christian era! Landa’s account
ought to convince the most prejudiced; proving the town to
have been, if not quite recent, comparatively so, and inhabited
when Montejo occupied it for the first time, in 1527, since
thirty-three years later (1560) devotees were still visiting its
shrines. This is also the conclusion arrived at by Stephens,
who had fewer data in support of it.</p>

<p>These pages had already been written when I received Chicxulub’s
Chronicles, written at the time of the Conquest, by the
Cacique Nakuk-Peck; translated and published by Brinton, Philadelphia,
1882, containing most valuable information whereby my
theory is strengthened with all the weight of an official document.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-355.jpg" width="500" height="323" alt="SACRED CENOTÉ OF CHICHEN-ITZA." />
<p class="caption">SACRED CENOTÉ OF CHICHEN-ITZA.</p></div>

<p>Sec. 4. Nakuk-Peck, writing of Montejo’s expedition to
Chichen-Itza, 1527, says: “He set out to reconnoitre the place
called Chichen-Itza, whence he invited <i>the chief of the town</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">Pg 355</a><br /><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">Pg 356</a><br /><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">Pg 357</a></span>to come and see him; and the people said unto him: ‘<i>There
is a King</i>, my Lord, <i>there is a King, even Cocom aun Peck,
King Peck, King Chel of Chicantum</i>;’ and Captain <i>Cupul</i> said
to him: ‘<i>Stranger warrior, take your rest in these palaces</i>.’
So spoke Captain <i>Cupul</i>.” After this, can it be further doubted
that Chichen was inhabited at the Conquest? Of Izamal he
says:</p>

<p>Sec. 18. “When the Spaniards established themselves at
Merida in 1542, the chief orator, the <i>high-priest Kinich-Kakmó
and the King of the Tutulxius from Mani, made their submission</i>.”
Obviously Kinich-Kakmó was the generic name for the high-priests
at Izamal who were in full possession of their religious
prerogatives at the coming of the Spaniards; consequently the
temples and palaces of both Izamal and Chichen were then inhabited.
These passages tell us, moreover, what we did not yet
know—that after the fall of Mayapan the head of the Cocomes
took possession of the principality of Chichen (the fall of Mayapan
and the migration of the Chichemecs were probably contemporaneous
events), that Kinich-Kakmó was the ally of Tutulxiu,
King of Mani, since, jointly with him, he offered his alliance to
Montejo, and that the latter and Cocom, both of Toltec descent,
were enemies struggling for supremacy over the province.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>We read in Torquemada and other writers that the first to
arrive in the country were the Cocomes, penetrating the
peninsula from Tabasco towards the end of the twelfth century,
under the command of their chief Quetzalcoatl, after they had
already subdued and civilised most of the northern portion of
Yucatan. They were succeeded a century later by the Tutulxius,
who marked their passage through the Usumacinta Valley by
the erection of Lorillard and Tikal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">Pg 358</a></span></p>
<p>Herrera and Landa tell us that “several tribes came from
Chiapas, having entered Yucatan by the south, although this
is not generally known to the natives themselves, but he (Landa)
conjectures it from the great number of names and verbal constructions
common to Chiapas and Yucatan, as from considerable
vestiges of deserted localities (Palenque, Ocosingo, and Lorillard,
etc.). These tribes dwelt in the wilderness south of the peninsula,
journeying hence to the hilly region of Kabah, Uxmal, etc., where
they settled down under their chief Tutulxiu, spreading everywhere
the worship of the Sun, the Moon, Tlaloc, and Quetzalcoatl,
their chief deities. They lived in great peace with the former
inhabitants, and with one another. They had no arms, snaring
animals with nets or taking them with lazos.”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Yet these kindred
tribes, the Cocomes and Tutulxius, so mild in disposition, became
fierce and quarrelsome soon after the settlement of the latter
in the district, both struggling for supremacy. In this conflict,
Mayapan was successively occupied by the victorious party,
while both succumbed to the caciques, who, taking advantage
of these inter-tribal contentions, consolidated their power, when
the peninsula was divided into eighteen independent provinces,
continually at war with each other, which finally worked the
destruction of the Maya-Toltec civilisation.</p>

<p>Aware of the treasures the cenoté might contain, I had provided
myself with two automatic Toselli sounding-machines, one
of which is capable of bringing up half a cubic metre deposit;
but unfortunately I could not get it to work, owing to the
height of the walls, the depth of the water, and the enormous
detritus of several centuries.</p>

<p class="caption">SMALL TEMPLE IN THE TENNIS-COURT OF CHICHEN-ITZA.</p></div>

<p>The Tennis-court is at once the largest and the best preserved
of any structure of this description; it consists of two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">Pg 359</a><br /><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">Pg 360</a><br /><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">Pg 361</a></span>perpendicular parallel walls from north to south, 34 by 325 feet,
32 feet high, and 113 feet apart. Both ends are occupied by
two small temples always seen in structures of this kind. The
southern edifice has no ornamentation of any interest; the
northern, which is shown in our cut, contains a single apartment,
with a portico to the south supported by columns, forming a
balcony whence the grandees witnessed the game sheltered
from the fierce rays of the sun.</p>

<p>The ruinous condition of this building will not allow us
to judge of its external decoration; but the columns and
the walls in the interior are covered with rows of human
figures in bas-relief, so damaged, however, that the subjects
represented cannot be recognised. The inner walls facing
each other, have in the centre of each, some 15 feet from the
ground, two stone rings with a hole through the centre,
similar to the one we dug up at Tula. The vast proportions
of this tlachtli indicate that the national Nahua game
was as eagerly played in Yucatan as on the table-land.</p>

<p>From the remaining sculptured fragments, whether bases, shafts
of columns, or reliefs, representing Quetzalcoatl, we are induced
to believe that this stately building was dedicated to this
god; all the more that the south end of the eastern wall
is occupied by a monument where his symbolical image is
everywhere seen. It consists of two apartments of different
size, richly decorated; a portico gave access to the main
chamber (our cut shows its dimensions), where the bases of the
columns are covered with finely sculptured serpents’ heads with
protruding tongues, over 9 feet long, bearing the characteristics
of those on the great temple at Mexico which date 1484-1486.</p>

<p>The southern façade of this monument has a beautiful interlaced
frieze, with a procession of tigers, divided by richly
fringed shields, bearing a strong resemblance to those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">Pg 362</a></span>
various tribes, published by Lorenzana with Cortez’ letters,
and similar to those generally seen in the Mexican manuscripts.
We think we recognise in this a monument of Quetzalcoatl
commemorating his victory over Tezcatlipoca in his foot-ball
match which took place at Tula, and that this is so seems
highly probable.</p>

<p>In the chamber which stood over the ruined portico
there was, twenty years ago, a series of paintings descriptive
of domestic and public life among the Mayas, now entirely
destroyed by barbarous explorers, or by the inhabitants of
Pisté. Stephens, who saw them, says that they were painted
in bright colours of blue, red, yellow, and green. Fortunately
for us, three sides of the pillars at the entrance are still
covered with sculptures, as also the lintels, and all are in
better preservation than any at Chichen-Itza, as may be seen
in our drawing. Here also we find numerous analogies with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">Pg 363</a></span>
Mexican monuments, which, it should be recollected, were the
result of Toltec teaching.</p>

<p class="caption">TIGERS’ BAS-RELIEFS ON PORTION OF TENNIS-COURT OF CHICHEN-ITZA.</p></div>

<p>All the human figures seen on these monuments have the
usual type of the Toltecs of the high plateaux. Their gala
dress, like that of the reliefs at page 362, is identical with the
dress of the figures on Tizoc’s stone. It is always a headdress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">Pg 364</a></span>

of feathers, a heavy collar of precious stones, a bundle
of arrows in the left hand, while the right carries a knife
similar to that carried by the figures of the Cuauhxicalli, so
that we might almost fancy we are following in the train of a
Nahua pageant so vividly portrayed by Sahagun, when he says:
“In the feast of the God
of Fire, which was held in
the month <i>Izcalli</i>” (the
eighteenth month), “the
nobles wore a high-fronted
paper coronet, with no back
to it, a kind of false nose
of blue paper, a collar and
medallions around their
necks, while in their hands
was carried a wooden knife,
the lower half of which was
painted red and the upper
white.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> In our cut, the
figure to the right wears
the mitre just described with
the piece of paper about the
nose, while the collar and
the wooden knife may be
seen in both, just like those
we see on Tizoc’s stone. The analogy is as curious as it is
striking.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-365.jpg" width="500" height="366" alt="TIZOC’S STONE, IN MEXICO." />
<p class="caption">TIZOC’S STONE, IN MEXICO.</p></div>

<p>Further, to the right of our drawing (page 365), the figures,
besides the huge feather head-dress, carry in their hands spears
barbed with feathers, like the figures to the extreme left on Tizoc’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">Pg 365</a></span>stone. These warriors are distributed in groups of two, the
conqueror to the left, the vanquished to the right; the latter
in the act of presenting the sacred knife he holds in his hand,
as a sign of submission. Some of the warriors, instead of the
knife, have a two-handed sword, “<i>macana</i>,” furnished with
blades of obsidian of Toltec manufacture; a few have their
noses pierced, and wear a golden ball, or the obsidian <i>bezoté</i>,
on their under-lip, as a badge of knighthood, which they had
adopted from the Nahuas of the Uplands. Further, each
figure, whether in the Mexican or Maya bas-relief, wears a
kind of casque, fashioned in the shape of a crocodile, a bird,
a serpent, or a duck’s head, etc., with his name on it. Slight
differences of style may occur here and there; for these
monuments belong to remote epochs, while Tizoc’s stone
only dates back to 1485; but the fact that they are found at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">Pg 366</a></span>
a distance of more than 900 miles from each other does not
make their resemblance less marvellous.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-366.jpg" width="500" height="329" alt="STATUE OF TLALOC FOUND AT CHICHEN-ITZA." />
<p class="caption">STATUE OF TLALOC FOUND AT CHICHEN-ITZA.</p></div>

<p>We will end our comparisons with a description of the following
statues, which ought to convert the most obstinate to our
theory. One was discovered at Chichen-Itza five or six years
ago, by Leplongeon, an American explorer; the other in the
neighbourhood of Tlascala, close to Mexico, at a considerable
distance from the former. The two statues represent the Toltec
god Tlaloc, according to Mr. Hamy, whose view I take. This
view receives additional probability from the existence of a third
statue, which was found I know not where, and which is the
property of Mr. Baron of Mexico, who bought it among several
other Aztec antiquities, and had it placed in his beautiful garden
at Tacubaya, whence it has, I suppose, been removed to Spain.
“This statue,” says Jesus Sanchez, “is smaller than the other two,
measuring but 3 feet by 1 foot 7 inches by 2 feet high. It
also represents a man lying on his back, his legs drawn up, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">Pg 367</a></span>
feet on the ground, and holding with both hands a vase which
rests against his body.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-367.jpg" width="500" height="365" alt="STATUE OF TLALOC OF TLASCALA (IN THE MUSEUM OF MEXICO)." />
<p class="caption">STATUE OF TLALOC OF TLASCALA (IN THE MUSEUM OF MEXICO).</p></div>

<p>There is no doubt that the same deity is figured in
these three statues, whatever the ornamentation, which varies
according to the epoch, the locality, or the imagination of
the artist. But Sanchez adds, “recollecting that a number
of Mexican statues were sculptured also beneath their base,
I turned this, when I discovered several devices in relief.
The sculptor had carved on the surface of the stone <i>a sheet of
water, aquatic plants, two frogs, and a fish</i>; while the bank was
occupied by <i>beans and grains of maize</i>, which are among the
attributes of Tlaloc.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> The statue in the Mexican Museum,
although found at Tlascala, must necessarily be Toltec from its
archaic character, and determines the origin of the second at
Chichen-Itza. When we add that the same customs, the same institutions,
the same manner of computing time, the same religion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">Pg 368</a></span>and the same arms, were common to both the tribes of the
plateaux and the Mayas of the peninsula, as recorded by all
ancient writers so often quoted in the course of this work, we
think we may even more positively affirm that the Yucatec
civilisation is both Toltec and recent.</p>

<p>There remains another monument to explore, which has not
been understood by former travellers, whilst the drawing given
by Stephens is altogether erroneous, but the probable use of
which we think we can explain. At a distance of some 162 feet
east of the Castillo, is a curious assemblage of several hundred
small columns in rows, five or six abreast, 13 feet apart from
each other, forming an immense quadrilateral. These columns,
6 feet high, some of which are still standing, consist of five round
pieces, crowned by a beautifully cut but plain square capital.</p>

<p>By far the greater proportion are lying on the ground, their
blocks disjointed but in order, while others are scattered about
in great confusion. Two edifices, now demolished, save some
fine sculptured fragments, occupied the angles north-east and
south-west of the quadrilateral. We are of opinion that this vast
structure was the Market-place.</p>

<p>It is not conceivable that so great a religious centre was not
possessed of an establishment similar to those found in all the
great cities of the Uplands, notably to any one familiar with the
narratives of the time of the Conquest, in which the Mexican and
Tlascalan market-places are described as having, like this monument,
low colonnades, galleries, and buildings occupied by the
judges entrusted with the various cases arising in and out of
the Market-place.</p>

<p>The importance attached to the market on the table-land,
leaves no doubt that it had equal rank in the peninsula, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">Pg 369</a></span>the manners and requirements were identical. “In Mexico,” says
Clavigero, “the judges of the commercial tribunal, twelve in
number, held their court in the market building, where they
regulated prices and measures, and settled disputes. Commissioners
acting under their authority patrolled the <i>tianquiztli</i>
(market-place) to prevent disorder. Any attempt at extortionate
charges, or at passing inferior or injured goods, or any infringement
of another’s right, was reported and severely punished.”<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>The king received a certain percentage on all goods brought
to the market, in return for the protection thus extended to the
merchants. The <i>tianquiztlis</i> of Texcuco, Cholula, and other
cities, were on a similar plan, and Cortez speaks of the market
at Tlascala as being attended by more than thirty thousand
people.</p>

<p>Sahagun enumerates the various products which were sold,
the judges who watched over the interests of buyers and sellers,
the perfect order enforced, and the importance of the markets.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>What more natural than to suppose that the markets of the
table-land had their counterpart in the peninsula, and that a great
city like Chichen should have had an important <i>tianquiz</i>, which
was frequented daily or at stated times by vast multitudes of
traffickers, or that provision should have been made for sheltering
them against the fierce tropical sun? Moreover, it is the only
structure here which could have been used as a market; while
its arrangement, the fact that it occupies the centre of the city,
favour our assumption. According to Dr. Montano, the Indian
word <i>tianquiz</i>, “market,” is <i>tianggi</i> in the Malay language.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our squeezes and our explorations had been going
on <i>pari passu</i>; the former consisting of impressions taken from
the best preserved and most interesting monuments. The labour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">Pg 370</a></span>was now brought to a satisfactory termination, and our thoughts
were directed to the packing and safe transport of so many
precious objects. When this was accomplished, I entrusted the
freight to some picked men to convey it to Pisté, whither we
should follow.</p>

<p>All the time we had been at Chichen we had looked, but in
vain, for Colonel Triconis’ promised visit. We regretted it all
the more as through his kindness we had obtained our escort,
which had proved so helpful in our work. Our saddle and pack-horses
had arrived from Citas; we were at the foot of the
pyramid, putting the last hand to the loading, when the Colonel
rode up. To shake hands, to tender our thanks for his civility,
was all we had time to do before we all set out for Pisté, where we
parted: Colonel Triconis to return to Valladolid, and we to Citas.</p>

<p>In the order of our march the squeezes went first, forming
immense rolls covered with tarpaulin. We followed in silence,
and our band had all the appearance of a funeral procession
conveying the sacred ornaments of the priests of olden time.</p>

<p>We reached Citas without accident, and two days later were
in Merida.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> road to Kabah, our next stage, passing by Ticul, lies as
usual through a flat tract of land, varied here and there by
plantations of henequen and maize. We reach the hacienda
of Uayalceh about nine o’clock, where we make a stay of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">Pg 372</a></span>
few hours to breakfast, visit the plantations and the house,
consisting of an immense pile of building surrounded by
cloisters, reared on an elevated eminence, presumably the site
of an Indian palace; it being doubtful whether the Spanish
builder would have gone to the enormous cost of constructing
so vast an esplanade. A gallery, extending over the whole
length of the building, is reached by twenty steps, where a
hammock, comfortable arm-chairs, and a writing-desk raised on
a platform are found, from which the mayor-domo can watch
unobserved the proceedings of the establishment. This hacienda
works its own henequen, employing some 1,200 hands; a strict
discipline is observed, and apart from the monotonous chant
of the youngsters, the low murmuring of the women, no sound
is heard save that of the machinery or the wheel at the
<i>Noria</i>, in constant movement for the requirements of the
whole establishment. It is altogether a lively and interesting
scene.</p>

<p>The large enclosure fronting the house is planted with
bananas, the whole zapotee family, cocoa and orange-trees
growing to the size of ilexes, alternated with roses and the
rich variety of the tropical flora, filling the air with their
sweet, penetrating fragrance, and extending to a wood which
surrounds the factory.</p>

<p>Our excellent breakfast is served in a portion of the cool
open cloister, washed down with a bottle of Spanish wine
and a delicious cup of coffee. We pay our moderate bill,
proffer our thanks to the mayor-domo for his civility, and resume
our march, alighting at the hacienda of Mucuiche to visit a
cenoté, and reach Sacalun late in the afternoon, where we
stop awhile to rest our hot, panting mules.</p>

<p>It was formerly a place of some importance; but its chief
attraction lies in its cenoté, 65 feet deep. Steps with a balustrade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">Pg 373</a></span>
lead to the surface of the water, while the great stalactites which
hang down from the vault and almost meet the stalagmites
rising from the ground, form an imposing and weird scene.
Yet it was here that I experienced the most charming adventure
that I met in the whole course of my travels; and, although
two-and-twenty years have elapsed, the dear, sweet remembrance
of that day is as fresh as ever.</p>

<p>I was on my way to Uxmal, when through some egregious
stupidity of the driver I was obliged to put up here for the
night. There was of course no inn, and I found a bed at a
poor widow’s, who took in casual travellers like myself. The
accommodation was of the scantiest: a hammock, a small table,
a chair or two, was all the furniture of a room which was at
the same time the kitchen, the parlour, and the sleeping chamber.
The widow apologised for having nothing better to offer, but
it was easy to guess from her noble manners and appearance,
that she had known better days. I watched my dinner being
prepared; the table neatly laid, everything so scrupulously clean,
that I could have found it in my heart to be indulgent had
the cooking been execrable, but all was as good and nice as would
have satisfied the most fastidious palate. Two lovely maidens
helped their mother and served at table; my eyes sought the
younger, whose transparent skin, pearly teeth, hair of raven
wing’s blackness, magnificent, languid eyes, fairy-like form
moving over the ground with an indescribable undulating movement,
moved me body and soul every time she gazed in my
direction. Her look of innocence and simplicity added to the
charm which seemed to emanate from her whole person, accepting
with child-like pleasure my open admiration, while a soft blush
spread over her countenance as she met my enraptured gaze.
Their story was this:</p>

<p>The hacienda had been burnt down, her husband massacred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">Pg 374</a></span>
and she had been obliged to fly with her little ones to escape
a worse fate, to find on their return the place a heap of ruins.
She told of their lone, joyless life, of a still darker future, and
tears coursed down her cheeks furrowed by care and privations
rather than age.</p>

<p>I was young, impulsive, I wished I were rich. Why should
I not.... In a moment, ancient monuments, the world, my
possible career, all was forgotten in face of these tearful countenances
and their undeserved misfortune. Why not accept
the love, the happiness, which were offered to me? And how
delightful to relieve their misery, to feel that a whole family
would be made happy and comfortable by me and through me!
All this and a great deal more I expressed, and was amply
repaid by the angelic smile of the young girl, and the mother’s
grateful acknowledgments. Night, however, brought calm to
my disturbed imagination, and I resolved on a speedy flight,
as the only means of escape from a too fascinating but dangerous
position. The next day I announced my departure, and I never
saw her again. And now, after so many years, I was back
in the same place again. I sought the house, to find that my
youthful love-dream was no longer here, but had gone to live
somewhere in a large city. I came away sad at heart, disappointed;
yet better so. In two-and-twenty years, Time, in
all probability, had not spared her, more than he had me.</p>

<p>Ticul, whither we are bound, is reached in the evening, where,
thanks to the kind offices of our friend Don Antonio Fajardo,
a house has been secured for our accommodation.</p>

<p>Ticul is built on the lower slopes of the Sierra, which runs
in a line from north-west to south-east of the peninsula. It
is a small place, with a few good houses and shops; everything
has a look of newness, as if built but yesterday, save
the church and the monastery falling into decay, in which lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">Pg 375</a></span>
the delightful padrecito Cirillo, whose pleasant gossip has been
so charmingly recorded in Stephens’ Journal. Almost the only
inhabitable apartment is now occupied by Cirillo’s brother, a
dear old fellow, whose cheery, smiling face it is a pleasure to see.
We make the “Tienda,” where we have our meals, our receiving-room;
our visitors are the schoolmaster, some Government
<i>employés</i>, the Mayor, and Dr. Cuevas, an eminent archæologist,
who presented me with a stick of zapoté, cut out of a lintel
found at Kabah. Our evenings pass pleasantly enough, in
agreeable conversation regarding the ruins found in this
district.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-375.jpg" width="500" height="343" alt="YUCATEC AND TEOTIHUACAN VASES." />
<p class="caption">YUCATEC AND TEOTIHUACAN VASES.</p></div>

<p>In this way we learn that the hacienda of S. Francisco,
some little distance from Sacalun, is an ancient Indian centre
with two unexplored mounds, in one of which a skeleton and
vases in good preservation were found some years since. I
was seized with the desire to explore these eminences, but my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">Pg 376</a></span>
repeated attempts proved bootless, and I was obliged to give
up the enterprise.</p>

<p>But kind friends here did not wish me to go away empty-handed,
so they sent me some vases which had been unearthed
in these mounds, just as I was sitting down in the evening to
record my failure. Two are shown in our cut, on each side of
the central one from Teotihuacan.</p>

<p>The resemblance between the ceramic art of Yucatan and that
of the table-land, is seen at a glance. Their value as works of
art is <i>nil</i>, but the peculiar ornamentation, common to all, cannot
be over-estimated from the point of view of our theory. On
examining this pottery, it is found that the potter made the vases
with reliefs, which he coloured, varnished, and baked before he
gave them to a carver who sculptured devices and figures with
a flint chisel, as seen on the larger Yucatec vase, where palms,
or, more likely, a symbolical figure was portrayed. The other is a
sitting figure, with a feather head-dress, and tassels towards the
top; whilst the Teotihuacan fragment represents a man in a
stooping posture, a stick or sceptre in his right hand, offering
an indeterminate object with his left to some figure engraved on
the portion of the vase which has disappeared.</p>

<p>Our route to the ruins of Kabah lay through the hacienda
of Santa Anna, to which they properly belong; but a path had to
be opened first through woods and forests, and as the work
would take two days at least, we accepted an invitation to
witness an entertainment given by Don Fajardo at his hacienda
of Yokat.</p>

<p>Entertainments are as well attended in this part of the world
by this pleasure-loving people, as in a city. This will last three
days, and will include national dances, bull-fights, high banqueting
and junketing. The owner, with natural pride, shows me the
vast proportions of his noble mansion, which stands at the foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">Pg 377</a></span>
of a hill and is surrounded by beautiful gardens full of flowers.
This being Sunday we all go to chapel, consisting in a long
rambling gallery. Mass is followed by a sermon in Maya, which
to my ear is very soft and pleasing.</p>

<p>The congregation numbers a large proportion of pretty
women, all in their gala dress, kneeling and devout; but at
the “Ite missa est,” they disappear swifter than a flight of
birds. I am introduced to the belles of the impending ball;
refreshments are handed round, when every one of these houris
comes up to dip her rosy lips in my glass; such is the fashion
here, which I need hardly say I think a very nice fashion
indeed. The guests are arriving very fast, filling already the
courtyard, and the immense open space fronting the house
which has been turned into a circus. Opposite to this is the
ballroom, a leafy bower of flowering shrubs and evergreens;
here and there are booths supplying thirsty customers with
fiery <i>staventum</i> and English beer; and ere long these people,
usually so grave and silent, make the whole place resound with
the hubbub of thousands of voices and peals of merry laughter
and joyful cries. The bulls have come; the circus is invaded
by an immense multitude, all eager to see the sport. For my
part, I prefer looking up at the galleries, crowded with beaming,
bewitching Meztizas. Ye immortals! What faces and what
figures! Mother Eve must have been a Meztiza, who “once
beguiled, is ever beguiling.”</p>

<p>Curious enough, in this assemblage, numbering over 2,000
people, hardly 400 men are found. As a fact, this disproportion
between the masculine and feminine element is more or
less noticeable in all warm countries, where the births average
five females to two males. This degeneracy does not apply
to the Indian portion of the population, for the civil wars, in
which great numbers of able-bodied men perished, have added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">Pg 378</a></span>
no doubt, to the feminine excess of the population. It is only
fair to state that this is mere assumption on my part, based on
no statistics, so that the fact may be exaggerated. What the
morals of the natives are in face of a quasi-seraglio life, is a
somewhat delicate question not easily answered. Broadly speaking,
it may be said that the Indians are not a virtuous race;
the frequency of these entertainments, extending over several
days or rather nights, is hardly conducive to strict propriety of
demeanour in an impassioned, amorous people. Be that as it
may, this assemblage offers many interesting types for observation:
the lower grades are a cross between the Malay and the
Chinese; the aquiline nose of former times has become flat, the
eyes somewhat sloping up, the lips thick, and the cheek-bones
prominent, while wavy hair indicates an admixture of negro
blood; very small hands, with thumbs so undeveloped as to
be almost simian, are also observable.</p>

<p>Wearied of the tumult and the discordant sounds of native
music, of national dances, which, however graceful, pall by
their sameness, I set my face towards Ticul, to look after
my men; when to my great relief I find that the path to
the ruins has been cleared, and I can start whenever I
choose. Don Antonio goes with us to the hacienda of Santa
Anna, which is to be our head-quarters; whence <i>volan-cochés</i>
will easily take us to Kabah, barely three miles distant.
This hacienda was abandoned like so many others during the
social war, and is now being restored with the material
of an important pyramid lying at a short distance, once
crowned by edifices now totally demolished. I notice square
pillars in the detritus in good preservation topped by Doric
capitals, and curiously enough, the angles are cut like the
stones of our pavements, and bear evident traces of a metal
instrument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">Pg 379</a></span></p>

<p>The road to the ruins has been so incompletely cleared, that
we are in danger of being upset every minute by rocks and trees
lying right over our path. In vain we desire the driver to
moderate his speed, to be more careful, we might as well order
the wind to be still; and at a sharp turn of the road the <i>volan</i>
comes with a tremendous crash against the trunk of a large tree,
and we are pitched out; the top of the carriage is smashed, and
with aching bones and a few scratches, we find our way to the
ruins on foot, now fortunately very near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">Pg 380</a></span></p>

<p>Ancient historians have made no mention whether of Kabah,
Sachey, Labphak, or Iturbide, cities lying thirty or forty
leagues south of Merida. Nevertheless, their rulers are incidentally
mentioned under the general appellation of “<i>people of the
Sierra</i>.” A glance at the map will show the position of these
cities on the other side of the mountain range which traverses
the peninsula.</p>

<p>Kabah was an important city, to judge from its monuments,
which extend over a large space, consisting of high pyramids,
immense terraces, triumphal arches, and stately palaces.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
Stephens, who visited the place in 1842, has given beautiful
drawings of its monuments; but the village, left to itself since
the rebellion, has become an impenetrable forest, making a
thorough exploration almost impossible. We were only able
to visit half-a-dozen structures, of which only two are still
standing. But these, coupled with those at Uxmal and Chichen,
will suffice to give a right and complete idea of Yucatec architecture
and civilisation.</p>

<p>The front of the first palace is richly decorated, consisting
of large figures like those at Chichen, and recalling to mind the
gigantic superimposed wooden idols met in the islands of the
Pacific. The ornamentation of this monument is so elaborate
that the architecture entirely disappears under it. Two salient
cornices form a frame to immense friezes which, in their details,
would compare favourably with our proudest monuments. The
advanced state of ruin in which the structure is found, makes
it difficult to judge of its original plan; but enough remains to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">Pg 381</a></span>show how unlike other monuments were the decorations which
extended over the whole façade, some 162 feet.</p>

<p class="caption">RUINS OF FIRST PALACE OF KABAH.</p></div>

<p>This palace, like all Yucatec monuments, rises on a two-storied
pyramid; fronting it is a vast esplanade, which had a
cistern on each side, while the centre was occupied by a “picoté.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">Pg 382</a></span>”
Over the front, narrowing towards the top, was a decorative wall,
usually found in Indian structures. Another peculiarity of these
monuments is their facing south and west, and north and east,
instead of the four cardinal points. The interior of this edifice has
a double range of apartments, the finest we have as yet seen,
measuring 29 feet long by 9 feet wide, and 19 feet high, supported
by half arches of overlapping stones. One of the inner chambers
is entered from the front apartment by three steps cut from a
single block of stone, the lower step taking the form of a scroll.
The walls at the sides, although half demolished, still show traces
of rich decoration, which consisted of the usual device, whilst
the projecting great figures of the façade are also noticeable on
the steps, on each side of which are large round eyes. The mouth
was below. All the apartments, and probably all the monuments,
had their walls painted with figures and inscriptions, as
shown in the few fragments which still remain. “Among the
Mayas,” says Viollet-le-Duc, “painting went hand-in-hand with
architecture, supplementing each other.” A picture as understood
among us held a very secondary place, while outer decorations
were all-important in the monuments at Kabah, which were
of brilliant colours, and must have greatly enhanced the striking
effect produced by these semi-barbarous, yet withal magnificent
edifices.</p>

<p>The second palace, 160 yards north-east of the first, is likewise
reared on a pyramid, fronted by an esplanade with two
cisterns and a picoté; it has besides a second plateau, consisting
of a range of ruined apartments. A flight of steps to the centre,
supported by a half-triangular arch, leads to the edifice. This
palace is only 16 feet high, and in strong contrast with the
rich, elaborate ornamentation of the first. Its outer walls are
plain, except groups of three short pilasters each surrounding
the edifice above the cornice, forming a sloping rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">Pg 383</a></span>
perpendicular frieze, like those at Palenque, and in most
Yucatec monuments. The front, 162 feet, is almost entire and
pierced by seven openings; two have columns and primitive
rude capitals, corresponding to the same number of narrow low
apartments. As usual the ornamental wall is narrowing towards
the top, and is distinctly seen through the vegetation covering
the roof.</p>

<p class="caption">SHOWING STEPS AND INTERIOR OF FIRST PALACE OF KABAH.</p></div>

<p>The rear is a complete ruin. Traces of painting, of which
tracings were made, are still visible in the central chamber. It
was here that I thought I recognised the rude drawing of a
horse and his rider, which was hailed with Homeric laughter;
but, although I was mistaken in my supposition, I was very
near the truth, since the fact I erroneously heralded at Kabah
was found in the north. The discovery is due to S. Salisbury,
who, in 1861, whilst exploring a group of mounds and structures,
near the hacienda of Xuyum, fifteen miles north of Merida,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">Pg 384</a></span>
unearthed the remains of <i>two horses’ heads</i>, made of very hard
chalk, with bristling hair like a zebra.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> The work shows
considerable artistic skill, and the explorer thinks that it formed
part of some bas-reliefs which had belonged to the demolished
monuments. Indeed, it is highly probable that these heads
were placed on the edifices built by the natives between Montejo’s
departure in 1530 and his return in 1541; proving that the
aborigines had skilfully copied the Spanish horses, and that
there was at Xuyum one monument at least similar to those
we know. To comment on this would be sheer loss of time.</p>

<p>To the left of this building is a rectangular pyramid, with
several stories, 162 feet at the base by 113 feet. Four outer
staircases led up from story to story to edifices in an advanced
state of ruin, having apartments extending all round, and doorways,
some supported by columns, while others are mere openings,
as shown in our drawing, which reproduces the north-west
side. In this monument and in the second palace are found
for the first time lintels of stone, nearly all in very good
preservation. Historians have told us nothing regarding Kabah;
nevertheless we have some guiding landmarks from which to
reconstruct its history and that of Uxmal, of which in all
probability it was a close ally, since the two cities lie at a
distance of five leagues from each other, and were connected
by a plastered road, traces of which are still visible. Consequently
the same fate must have been common to both. We know
that a century before the Conquest the lord of Mayapan
ruled over the whole peninsula, having razed to the ground
the capitals of his vanquished rivals, amongst whom were the
caciques of Uxmal, Kabah, Labna, etc. This king of Mayapan
introduced into the country a force of Mexican soldiers for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">Pg 385</a><br /><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">Pg 386</a><br /><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">Pg 387</a></span>the maintenance of his authority;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> and to ensure the good behaviour
of the caciques he obliged them to reside at his court,
where their state of vassalage was made up to them by a life
of great pomp, at the expense of the sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p class="caption">NORTH-WEST SIDE OF PYRAMID OF KABAH.</p></div>

<p>Now as the Aztec independence only dates from the reign
of Itzcoatl (1426), their conquests and subsequent power cannot
be earlier than the reign of Montezuma I. (1440); it is obvious,
therefore, that they were not in a position to send reinforcements
before 1440 to the ruler of Mayapan. This autocracy lasted but
a few years; a coalition of the people of the Sierra was formed,
war broke out, the king of Mayapan was vanquished, the city
captured and sacked, when the hostage caciques returned to their
native provinces. Landa places this event in 1420, whilst
Herrera gives 1460 as the probable date. We think the latter
justifies his chronology, since he writes “that seventy years
elapsed between the fall of Mayapan and the coming of the
Spaniards, varied by years of plenty, storms, pestilence, intestine
wars, followed by twenty years of peace and prosperity down
to the arrival of the Europeans.”<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>He further states that each cacique took away from Mayapan all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">Pg 388</a></span>the scientific books they could conveniently carry, and that on
their return home they erected temples and palaces, which is
the reason why so many buildings are seen in Yucatan; that
following on the division of the territory into independent
provinces, the people multiplied exceedingly, so that the whole
region seemed but one single city.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> Landa says “the monuments
were built by the natives in possession of the country
at the time of the Conquest, since the bas-reliefs represent them
with their types, their arms, and their dress;” and “that on
going through the woods and forests, groups of houses and
palaces of <i>marvellous construction</i> were found.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> This is sufficiently
clear, and whether these monuments were inhabited or
not at the coming of the Spaniards, is beside the question. On
the other hand, the prosperity mentioned by Herrera and Landa
found expression in the peculiar monument, which in its original
plan represented the florid style, always observable at the end
or the brilliant beginning of a new art, being the reproduction of
an older style, varied by elaborate ornamentation of questionable
taste.</p>

<p class="caption">BAS-RELIEFS AT KABAH (FROM STEPHENS).</p></div>

<p>It is usual for a nation to commemorate a return to independence
by the erection of triumphal arches, statues, and
monuments. That this was the case at Kabah is shown in
the two remarkable bas-reliefs in our drawings, which were
probably part of a monument raised in honour of the victory
obtained by the allied caciques. Like the Tizoc stone, these
bas-reliefs represent a conqueror, in the rich Yucatec costume,
receiving the sword of a captive Aztec; the latter is easily
recognised from his plainer head-dress and the maxtli girding
his loins. His head-dress is identical to those described by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">Pg 389</a></span>
Lorenzana in his letters to Cortez and Charles V., and not
unlike those which the Mexican conquerors sometimes exacted
from their vanquished foes. The other bas-relief has the same
characteristics, but the head-dress is even more significant, for
it is fashioned out of the head of an animal like those of the
Mexican manuscripts. In this relief the conqueror spares the
life of the vanquished, bidding him depart in peace. It is
obvious, nay, we affirm, that this is a representation of a battle
between Yucatecs and Mexicans dating somewhere between 1460<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">Pg 390</a></span>
and 1470;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> since we know that Mayapan was the only city which
implored the aid of the Aztecs, and that after its destruction
the inhabitants obtained permission to establish themselves in
the province of Maxcanu, east of Merida, where their descendants
are found to this very day. These repetitions were necessary to
convince a class of archæologists who claim for these monuments
a hoary antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Kabah to Santa Helena we travel at last on a good road,
wide enough to secure us against collisions, smooth enough and
shady enough to make locomotion highly agreeable; a sensation
which is increased rather than diminished on reaching the
beautiful native village of Santa Helena, extending over a wide
expanse divided in square blocks like a modern town. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">Pg 392</a></span>
dwelling is planted with <i>ciruelos</i>, with orange-trees, a profusion
of flowers, and encompassed by a fencing wall. Near the huts
are aerial gardens, made by means of poles fixed in the ground
supporting twined branches covered over with a few inches of
earth, where the cottagers grow flowers and vegetables; while
the yard is occupied by multitudes of cackling hens, quacking
ducks, and grunting pigs. The church stands in the centre of
the village, on the site of an ancient temple.</p>

<p>This hamlet was like a vision of the past, for from all we had
seen and knew, it was easy to conjure up what it had been in
former times. Nor will it seem unnatural that little or no modification
should be observable in an Indian village, if it be considered
what powerful factors are traditions, instincts, and surroundings,
particularly with a rural population. When the Spaniards imposed
their religion on the Mayas, they did so by the sword rather
than persuasion; but the natives retained their culture, their
customs, and their national dress, whereas the conquerors forgot
their own language, were modified at the contact of the subdued
race, and adopted their ancient institutions, the better to replace
the caciques.</p>

<p>Yucatan, as we have seen, was under a feudal system of
government before the Conquest, when it was followed by
“encomiendas,” giving the Spaniards the right to enforce
the services of the natives to the number of one or two
thousand to each cavalier according to his importance. The
marks of this system are observable in all great buildings which
formerly were a centre or a manor-house; whilst from the
number of pyramids may be surmised the power of the cacique
once the lord of the locality. At the present day, it is true,
centres are few in number, and in consequence of the cruel
treatment of the natives by the conquerors, they have fallen
to a tenth of their primitive numerical strength; yet cities, ham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">Pg 393</a></span>lets,
and haciendas are even now standing witnesses of how far
superior was the condition of the Mayas before the coming of
the Europeans. Nothing is changed, save that the ancient lords
have fallen into servile condition, that haciendas and Moorish-Spanish
structures have superseded the princely palaces and
the mansions of the gentry, and that the straight American
doorway and triangular arch are replaced by the Arab-Hispano
arch; but if the ancient palaces are a ruinous mass, the huts
of the peasantry cluster now as of old around the manor-house.
Religion alone has changed; the church has succeeded to the
temple without replacing it; the Christian dogma seems cold
and arid to a singularly mystic people, who in the days of their
national life peopled the forests with votive chapels and mysterious
voices.</p>

<p>To continue: we reach safely Sac-Akal, a wretched hacienda
lost in a trackless wilderness, when we disappear in the dense
vegetation which completely invades our path, and after
much difficulty we arrive at the hacienda of Uxmal late in the
evening. We are received by the mayor-domo, Don Perez,
and, under the auspices of his charming daughter, an excellent
supper is soon got ready; when, with feet under the table,
and a pleasant talk with our host, the fatigues and harass
of the journey are soon forgotten. The hacienda is no longer
the dismal habitation of former days; on its site is reared
an imposing pile of building, containing lofty apartments,
surrounded by open cloisters. A sugar factory gives employment
to a large number of hands, while a tramway connects
it with the sugar plantations, and facilitates the transport to
the mill. All is bustle, movement, and noise; but the place
is now as unhealthy as ever, and the mayor-domo himself is
a martyr to fever and ague.</p>

<p>The ruins are some two thousand yards beyond. We set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">Pg 394</a></span>
out the next day to visit them; but the aspect of these old
palaces, which I had looked forward to visiting with so much
anticipation, was most disappointing. Owing to the vegetation
which is suffered to clothe everything with its thick green
mantle, the general outline of the city, nay, an entire structure,
is no longer discernible. From their state of good preservation
some monuments at Uxmal seem to belong to the revival
we noticed at Kabah, and to be more recent than those at
Chichen.</p>

<p>The place has been so often visited and written about that
we will limit ourselves with describing the palaces reproduced
in our cuts, noticing, at the same time, any fresh indication
in support of our theory.</p>

<p>The Governor’s Palace, reared on three successive colossal
terraces, is the most extensive, the best known, and the
most magnificent monument of Central America; its ornamentation
is in turns simple or very elaborate. The frieze,
which runs in a line of 325 feet, having a row of colossal
heads, divided in panels, filled alternately with grecques in
high relief, and diamond or lattice-work, is most striking in
its effect. The palace looks new, although it has been
abandoned for over three hundred years; and it would be entire
had it not been for the vandalism of its owners, who used
the stones of the basement for the erection of their hacienda.</p>

<p>The youthful appearance of this edifice is obvious to the
observer, for monuments, like men, carry more or less their
age on their countenance, which a thoughtful mind can easily
read. Their wrinkles are seen in the fissures of their walls,
in their stones eaten away by the elements, whilst the moss,
the trees, and the lianas mantling over them, complete their
hoary exterior.</p>

<p>A tradition derives the name of Uxmal from a word meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">Pg 395<br />Pg 396<br />Pg 397</a></span>
“thrice built;” whether the town was demolished and reconstructed,
or whether its monuments were built three times, does
not appear. The latter version would indicate the Indian method
of building. In fact, this is seen in all our drawings of the palace,
where the fallen edifice shows that the inner wall is in a perfect
state of preservation, forming an independent work. These inner
walls formed the apartments of the edifice, and in all probability
were perpendicular to a height of some 6 to 9 feet, when the side
walls began to approach each other so as to form the false vault
(triangular arch) of the double range of apartments of the
palace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-395.jpg" width="500" height="329" alt="THE GOVERNOR’S PALACE, UXMAL." />
<p class="caption">THE GOVERNOR’S PALACE, UXMAL.</p></div>

<p>This was the shell or first construction. Then the interval
between the arches was filled by layers of stone, whilst the outside
walls, resting on the arches, were solid masonry. This was the
second construction. Then came the third, when the outer walls
were covered with tenons and sculptures. It should be added
that this mode of building is applicable to all stone structures,
and may have been generally adopted.</p>

<p>Two cisterns and a picoté are found on the esplanade facing
the palace. The entrance or mouth to each cistern is a circular
opening, 9 feet deep by 16 feet in diameter. Similar excavations
are of frequent occurrence throughout the city of Uxmal and the
vicinity, where they were chiefly used by the lower orders. There
were also great artificial reservoirs, with cisterns at the bottom
for collecting rain-water.</p>

<p>The decoration on the main entrance of this palace deserves
particular mention. The wooden lintels have been removed, the
projecting cornice has fallen; but above it the walls were covered
with ornamentation in high relief of infinite skill and magnificence,
which, alas! has been destroyed or carried away by early explorers.
Higher still are three eagles with half-spread wings,
followed by a circular pedestal supporting the mutilated bust of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">Pg 398</a></span>
a human figure, without arms, and whose head, now deficient, was
surmounted by a lofty plumed head-dress. In the plinth are three
heads of Roman type, beautifully executed; while on each side
of the main figure are the inscriptions which we reproduce.</p>

<p><span class="figleft350" style="width: 350px;">

<span class="caption">PORTION OF THE GOVERNOR’S PALACE, UXMAL.</span></span>
At Uxmal, all
the lintels over
the doorways are
of wood, of which
a large proportion
is in a perfect state
of preservation—a
clear proof of
their recent period.
Nor were these the
only pieces of wood
used in these buildings:
across the
ceilings from side to
side, and about mid-height,
stretched
small wooden
beams, the ends of
which were built in
the stone-work, as
seen by the holes
in the walls and
the ends of the
beams which have not completely disappeared. We have said
in a former chapter that doors were unknown to the aborigines;
here four rings or stone hooks are found inside the doorways
near the top, from which it is easy to conjecture that a wooden
board was placed inside against the opening, and kept in place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">Pg 399</a></span>
by two transversal bars entering the stone hooks. It is the
only place where I have observed this innovation, which seems
to indicate a later epoch for Uxmal.</p>

<p>Phallus worship was recognised and practised both on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">Pg 400</a></span>
plateaux and in Yucatan, and numerous traces have been found
everywhere; whilst here, a collection is to be seen in the
Governor’s Palace.</p>

<p class="caption">NORTH WING FAÇADE OF THE NUNNERY OF UXMAL.</p></div>

<p>The Nunnery is the largest building at Uxmal; if less
magnificent than the Governor’s Palace, its ornamentation is
throughout exceedingly rich, varied, and elaborate. We give
Stephens’ plan and measurements. This monument, supported
on three superimposed terraces, forms a vast quadrangle
consisting of four wings of different dimensions, surrounding
a court 258 feet by 214 feet. The southern front is 279 feet
long, while the centre is occupied by the main entrance,
10 feet 8 inches wide, with a triangular arch some 20 feet high.
This side is less richly decorated than the rest. Facing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">Pg 401</a></span>
this entrance stands the northern wing, the ornamentation
of which is wonderfully diversified, consisting of
grecques, lattice-work, and bas-reliefs, representing birds and
human beings, whilst small porticoes, intersected by pavilions
with the usual superimposed great idols, are found everywhere.
The southern front is reared on a terrace which
is reached by a stairway 264 feet long by 95 feet wide,
and about 25 feet high; it is pierced by thirteen openings,
corresponding to a range of thirteen small apartments two deep.
The western wing, almost entirely destroyed, gives nevertheless
a good idea of its fine ornamentation. It consisted of a frieze
divided into panels with the usual devices, and huge Indian
statues in high relief; two immense feathered serpents wreathed
the panels occupying the whole length of the façade, 173 feet
from end to end, whilst the heads, and the tails with
rattles, met at the extremities, like those on the table-land. The
eastern wing is entire and almost intact; the front measures
158 feet, having an elegant frieze composed of stone trellis-work,
intersected by serpentine trophies disposed in fan-like
fashion, while towards the top are symbolic figures admirably
treated. This side is severe in design, more simple, and in
better taste than the rest. The Nunnery consisted of eighty-eight
apartments, of all dimensions, varying from 19 feet to 32
feet long.</p>

<p class="caption">SHOWING DETAILS OF EASTERN FAÇADE OF THE NUNNERY, UXMAL.</p></div>

<p>The Dwarf’s House, also the Casa del Adivino, the Prophet’s
House, is a charming temple crowning a pyramid with a very
steep slope 100 feet high. It consists of two parts: one reared
on the upper summit, the other a kind of chapel lower down,
facing the town. It was richly ornamented, and presumably
dedicated to a great deity. Two stairways facing east and west
led to these buildings. Padre Cogolludo, who visited this temple
in 1656, is the first to complain of the steep staircase, which caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">Pg 402</a></span>
his head to swim. He found in one of these apartments offerings
of <i>cocoa and copal which had been burnt very recently</i>; consequently,
fifteen years after the Conquest the natives were still
sacrificing to their gods, and practising their superstitions in their
own temples. That these edifices were entire in Cogolludo’s
time is beyond doubt, since the Governor’s Palace, the eastern
and southern sides of the Nunnery, are still standing. They
appeared new to Lizana, who (1616) says: “These buildings
are alike both in style and architecture; all are reared on supporting
mounds (<i>ku</i>, plural <i>kues</i>), which inclines one to think
that they were built at the same time, by the order of one guiding
head, seeing that they are similar. Some look so new and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">Pg 403</a></span>
clean, their wooden lintels so perfect, that they do not seem to
<i>have been built more than twenty years</i>. These palaces must have
<i>been used as temples and sanctuaries</i>, for the dwellings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">Pg 404</a></span>
natives were thatched, and always in the depths of the
forests.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>This quotation is not indicative of very early monuments,
while it shows that the similarity of the monuments was noticed
and recorded by the first explorers; it will not, therefore, appear
unnatural that aided by documents, when we write the history of
one monument should be equivalent to writing the history of
all; and that the architectural manifestations which are identical
throughout Central America should be ascribed to one people,
the Toltecs. The culture of a nation is gauged by their
monuments; if so, where are the structures marking the existence
of the Toltecs? Although of great solidity, and not four
hundred years old, had they entirely disappeared at the time
of the Conquest, and are the monuments we now behold
the remains of ancient buildings unknown to them? But
such a conclusion is belied by history and tradition. We will
terminate these discussions with a few words from Cogolludo,
who says of these edifices: “<i>They are about the same as
those in New Spain, described by Torquemada in his ‘Indian
Monarchy.</i>’”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>Stephens has a legend relating to the Dwarf’s House, which
we reproduce: “An old woman lived alone in her hut, rarely
leaving her chimney-corner. She was much distressed at having
no children; in her grief, one day she took an egg, wrapped
it up carefully in a cotton cloth, and put it in a corner of her
hut. She looked at it every day with great anxiety, but no
change in the egg was observable; one morning, however, she
found the shell broken, and a lovely tiny creature was stretching
out its arms to her. The old woman was in raptures; she took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">Pg 405</a></span>it to her heart, gave it a nurse, and was so careful of it, that at
the end of a year the baby walked and talked as well as a grown-up
man; but he stopped growing. The good old woman in her
joy and delight exclaimed that the baby should be a great chief.
One day, she told him to go to the king’s palace and engage
him in a trial of strength. The dwarf begged hard not to be
sent on such an enterprise; but the old woman insisted on
his going, and he was obliged to obey. When ushered into
the presence of the sovereign, he threw down his gauntlet; the
latter smiled, and asked him to lift a stone of three arobes
(75 lb.). The child returned crying to his mother, who sent
him back, saying: ‘If the king can lift the stone, you can lift
it too.’ The king did take it up, but so did the dwarf. His
strength was tried in many other ways, but all the king did
was as easily done by the dwarf. Wroth at being outdone
by so puny a creature, the prince told the dwarf that unless
he built a palace loftier than any in the city, he should die. The
affrighted dwarf returned to the old woman, who bade him not
to despair, and the next morning they both awoke in the palace
which is still standing. The king saw with amazement the
palace; he instantly sent for the dwarf and desired him to collect
two bundles of <i>cogoiol</i> (a kind of hard wood), with one of which
he would strike the dwarf on the head, and consent to be struck
in return by his tiny adversary. The latter again returned to
his mother moaning and lamenting; but the old woman cheered
him up, and placing a tortilla on his head, sent him back to
the king. The trial took place in the presence of all the State
grandees; the king broke the whole of his bundle on the dwarf’s
head without hurting him in the least, seeing which he wished
to save his head from the impending ordeal, but his word
had been passed before his assembled court, and he could not
well refuse. The dwarf struck, and at the second blow, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">Pg 406</a></span>
king’s skull was broken to pieces. The spectators immediately
proclaimed the victorious dwarf their sovereign. After this
the old woman disappeared; but in the village of Mani, fifty
miles distant, is a deep well leading to a subterraneous passage
which extends as far as Merida. In this passage is an old
woman sitting on the bank of a river shaded by a great tree,
having a serpent by her side. She sells water in small
quantities, accepting no money, for she must have human beings,
innocent babies, which are devoured by the serpent. This old
woman is the dwarf’s mother.”</p>

<p>Uxmal is the only city where the monuments are so grouped
as to make it possible to take a panoramic view, which the reader
can follow one by one in our drawing. To the left, in the
distance, is the “Casa de la Vieja,” the Old Woman’s House;
next comes the Governor’s Palace, showing the west side and
about three-fourths of the edifice; more in front, to the right,
the “Casa de las Tortugas,” Turtle House, so called from a row
of turtles occurring at regular intervals above the upper cornice.
To the rear, a great pyramid crowned by a vast platform, without
monuments, known as “Cerro de los Sacrificios,” Mound of
Sacrifice. It is on the plan of the Mexican temples, which consisted,
like this monument, of a pyramid with small wood chapels
containing idols and the terrible <i>techcatl</i>. The Toltecs, who did
not practise human sacrifice, had real temples on the summits
of their pyramids, like those in Yucatan, where they developed
this kind of architecture. Consequently, if human sacrifices are
met among the Mayas, they must be attributed to Mexican
influence, and all writers agree that the monuments devoted to
this horrible practice date from the fifteenth century (1440), and
are of Aztec origin.</p>

<p>To the right of this mound is another pyramid, having several
stories like the Castillo at Chichen, and similar monuments at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">Pg 407<br />Pg 408<br />Pg 409</a></span>
Palenque; it was crowned by a beautiful temple, now in a very
ruined condition. Still to the right, but more in front, is the
curious building known as “Casa de las Palomas,” Pigeon House,
owing to immense peaks terminating the decorative wall, pierced
by large openings arranged in horizontal rows, which may well
have served as a pigeon-house. It should be added that at
Uxmal the decorative wall is only found in the most dilapidated
monuments deficient of any stucco mouldings, showing an earlier
epoch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-407.jpg" width="500" height="323" alt="GENERAL VIEW OF THE RUINS OF UXMAL." />
<p class="caption">GENERAL VIEW OF THE RUINS OF UXMAL.</p></div>

<p>Fronting these buildings, on the second plan, are more ruins;
the most conspicuous being the Tlachtli or Tennis-court, and the
south side of the Nunnery with its main entrance, which gives
access to the inner court, where traces of pavement are still visible.</p>

<p>An official document given by Stephens will confirm our
views respecting these monuments. Stephens found it among
the papers of the Peon family, in a petition from Don Lorenzo
Evia to the King of Spain (1673), praying a grant of four leagues
of land from the buildings of Uxmal, “since,” he says, “no
injury could result to any third person, but on the contrary
very great service to God our Lord, because with that
establishment it would prevent the Indians in those places
from worshipping the devil in the ancient buildings which
are there, having in them their idols, to which they burn copal
and perform other detestable sacrifices, <i>as they are doing every
day notoriously and publicly</i>.” And further: “In the place
called the edifices of Uxmal and its lands, the 3rd day of the
month of January, 1688,” etc.,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> concluding: “In virtue of the
power and authority given me by the Governor, I took the hand
of the said Lorenzo, and he walked with me all over Uxmal
and its buildings, opened and shut some doors, cut within the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">Pg 410</a></span>space some trees, picked up stones and threw them down,
drew water from one of the aguados, and performed other acts
of possession.”</p>

<p>This was 150 years after the Conquest; but by this time
the reader must be convinced that edifices, notably at Uxmal,
were inhabited before and after the coming of Europeans; that
they were recent, and that, broadly speaking, the monuments of
Yucatan were the work of the existing race, erected at various
epochs by the Toltec conquerors.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>We will end these long discussions by a quotation from Baron
Friedrichsthal, regarding the probable age of these ruins, showing
that our theory was promulgated some forty-three years ago, not
only by Stephens, but also by the illustrious German scholar:
“Historians are unanimous in ascribing all the existing stone
structures to the Toltecs or the Aztecs. The latter, however,
did not invade New Spain until the middle of the thirteenth
century, while no traces are found of their having migrated south.
Aztec architecture is quite distinct from the Toltec, which a comparison
of Mexican buildings with those found at Palenque
sufficiently show; the latter being generally ascribed to the
Toltecs by all ancient authorities. The evident analogy which
exists between the edifices at Palenque and the ruins in Yucatan,
favours the assumption of one origin, although different epochs
must be assigned to each, by reason of the progress visible in
their treatment. To fix these epochs with some show of
probability seems to us, if not impossible, at least very difficult.
A thorough exploration, supported by a minute and exhaustive
comparison of the standing remains, coupled with a careful observation
of the causes and circumstances which have produced or
contributed to the state of dilapidation wherein these ruins are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">Pg 411</a></span>found, could alone throw some light across the darkness which has
settled over these monuments for so many centuries.” (This is
exactly what we have done.)</p>

<p>“The solidity of these edifices is not equal to that of monuments
of other nations, which were built throughout the thickness
of their walls with stones of different size; whereas the inside
of the American wall is a rude mixture of friable mortar and
small irregular stones. This heterogeneous composition must
have produced the rupture or dislocation of the outward facing
as soon as the whole was under the influence of atmospheric
moisture, and the rapid infiltrations which were produced by
its upper portions. Moreover, the calcareous stone used in
these buildings is considered as a very inferior material, as
seen by the progressive decomposition of those portions of
the buildings which are exposed to the direct influence of
the north-east wind, and the consequent action of the prevailing
rain. Nor is this all. In the wood used in almost
all northern structures, examples are met of resinous wood
having lain buried or submerged, in a semi-state of petrifaction,
over a thousand years. Now in the Yucatec ruins the cornices
and lintels of the doorways, of zapoté wood, were exposed to
the open air. This wood, although very hard, not being
resinous like cedar, is attacked by devouring insects. For
this reason it does not seem probable that these woods are
more than <i>six</i> or <i>seven</i> hundred years old. If this supposition
be called purely hypothetical, the thoughtful reader has a perfect
right to form his opinion from more solid data, while I claim
the same to express mine; not that I deem myself infallible—for,
says the German proverb, ‘Truth is only attained after
repeated tumbles on the rocks of error.’”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">Pg 412</a></span></p>
<p>American monuments, considered artistically, are but the
rude manifestations of a semi-barbarous race, which it were
idle to endow with intrinsic value, seeing that their original
plans are wanting both in accuracy and symmetry, while their
materials are ill-cut, their joints far apart even in bas-reliefs,
where the intervening spaces are filled up with cement. Consequently
these buildings cannot compare with Indian, Egyptian
or Assyrian monuments; for here we have a nation who in
the whole course of their political life, extending over several
centuries, produced but one note, emitted but one sound;
because they had neither traditions nor a higher civilisation
around them to draw from. And, although here and there
some happier mood is seen, whether in sculpture or cement
modelling, their occurrence is too rare ever to have become
general. The chief merit of these buildings lies in their
interest for the archæologist and the intelligent, who are
necessarily few; and this explains the silence of the conquerors
respecting them. How well I remember my servant’s strictures
on hearing my exclamation of delightful surprise as I stood
the first time before the Governor’s Palace: “Well, I can’t,
for my part, see anything so wonderful in it; there isn’t a
French bricklayer who couldn’t do quite as well and better.”
François, on his return home, would no more have dreamt
of recounting of the wonderful buildings he had seen in the
New World, than did the Spaniards three hundred years before.</p>

<p>It is with something of the feeling which is experienced at
parting from a long-cherished friend that we take leave of
the curious, barbarous, yet withal charming ruins, thrice visited
with delight ever fresh, with interest all the more vivid that
I have succeeded in lifting the deep shroud which covered
them, and if on that account they are no longer surrounded
with mysterious awe, they will not be less interesting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">Pg 413</a></span></p>

<p>We set out, directing our march through Muna, which has
a fine well, seemingly of Indian construction. A native feast is
being held, and here, as throughout the State, it means a grand
opportunity for getting drunk. We push on, sleep at a broken-down
hovel called Abala, and the next day we are once
more comfortably settled among our household gods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> we take our passage for Campeche on the <i>Asturia</i>, a
diminutive, small steamer, having but four Liliputian berths;
luckily enough we are the only passengers; had it been otherwise,
we must have kept on deck day and night. The sea is like
an immense sheet of glass, the heavens radiant with stars; our
boat draws very little water, so that we skirt close to the shore,
and are able to follow the graceful panorama which unfolds before
us; and in the morning early we cast anchor four miles off
Campeche because of the high surf, but the outline of which is
plainly visible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-415.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="CAMPECHE." />
<p class="caption">CAMPECHE.</p></div>

<p>Campeche was built on the site of an Indian city, and
visited by Antonio Cordova in his first ill-fated expedition (1517).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">Pg 415</a><br /><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">Pg 416</a><br /><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">Pg 417</a></span>“The natives,” says Diaz, “were friendly, and took us to extensive
buildings which had in them idols and sanctuaries. These
edifices were built of lime and sand. On the walls were enormous
serpents, and near them paintings representing their idols, round
a kind of altar stained with drops of blood still quite fresh. On
one side of the idols were painted human figures massed in the
shape of a cross. We were amazed at the sight of things so
strange, as we watched numbers of natives, men and women,
come in to get a sight of us with smiling, unconcerned countenances.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>
But the scene soon changes; osier braziers, for
burning copal, are brought, and the priests tell the Spaniards
to leave the shore immediately under penalty of death. The
Spaniards sailed away, and did not settle at Campeche until
1541.</p>

<p>These ancient mounds, these temples, with their ceremonial
and gory priests, carry us back to Mexico; but it would be
vain to look for traces of such buildings along the coast, or in
the proximity of Spanish settlements. In process of time
Campeche became the most nourishing city of the peninsula,
and was plundered several times by French and English privateers.
To stop these frequent devastations, a strong wall was
built around to enable its inhabitants to rest in peace. But
the wall, built for safety, seems now to oppress the town,
which has outgrown it, and is spreading outside, where wealthy
merchants have “quintas,” in whose gardens the rich tropical
flora displays its magnificence, casting a multicoloured belt about
the town.</p>

<p>Campeche, with its tortuous suburbs, its drawbridges, its
unsymmetrical high buildings, is the least Eastern-looking place
in Mexico, and boasts no monuments worthy of mention. Our
steamer stopped some hours here, giving me the opportunity to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">Pg 418</a></span>pay a long-promised visit to Don F. Ferrer, a charming
correspondent, under whose hospitable roof I spent one of the
pleasantest days I can remember, amidst music and pleasant
talk. We returned to our steamer <i>en route</i> for Carmen in the
afternoon, and I looked forward to having the whole boat to
myself, when a large canoe full of people rowed up alongside just
as we were settling down comfortably. “Oh dear!” I thought,
“three days’ voyage with a surplus of eighteen people, not counting
half-a-dozen curs and parrots! If the <i>norte</i> gets up, what is
to become of us?” They were strolling actors who had long
secured all the available accommodation, so that we were given
the choice of the deck, and it was with difficulty that I obtained
for Lucian, who was prostrated with a severe attack of fever,
a wee corner below. Presently his moans attracted the attention
of the women. “What is the matter with the gentleman,
is it yellow fever?” they inquired. “I shouldn’t wonder,”
was my reply; whereupon the whole band made off and left
us in undisturbed possession of our berths, where we slept
the sleep of the just, and arrived at Carmen as fresh as larks.
This place is the great depôt for woods known as Campeche,
and drives a brisk trade.</p>

<p>I found my old friend Don Benito, who owns an island
called Chinal on the Usumacinta, having mounds, tombs, or
maybe basements of temples. Some excavations were made
in them, when terra-cotta guns, 4 feet 11 inches long, with
bullets likewise of terra-cotta, were brought to light. I was
presented with some bullets, which are now in the Trocadéro.
The only plausible explanation I can give for the presence
of these guns in an Indian mound, is that after the great
battle of Centla in Tabasco, in which Cortez’ artillery wrought
so much destruction, the natives tried to copy this new war-engine,
but being unacquainted either with iron or the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">Pg 419</a></span>
of powder, they reproduced them in the material most familiar
to them, fondly imagining that the result would be the same, and
buried them later with their chief.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-419.jpg" width="500" height="317" alt="HOTEL GRIJALVA AT FRONTERA." />
<p class="caption">HOTEL GRIJALVA AT FRONTERA.</p></div>

<p>The journey from Carmen to Frontera takes twelve hours,
where we land the very day twelve months after our first visit,
and put up again at the detestable fonda. We learn that smallpox
and yellow-fever have decimated and are decimating the
town, but nothing daunted, for these epidemics seem to spare
foreigners, I fill up the time I must wait here until a steamer
calls, by collecting ancient pottery. Indian idols are of frequent
occurrence in Central America, but up to the present time no one
has cared to collect them, and the Mexican Museum does not
possess a single specimen. Among those I picked up are various
figures resembling more or less those of the table-land, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">Pg 420</a></span>
their differences of style connect them with the idols at Palenque.
Our drawing shows the two best preserved, and although very
rude in make, they are not devoid of interest. The figure to the
left is a Quetzalcoatl, easily recognised from the serpent surrounding
his head, and is the facsimile of a stone idol at Capan;
while the larger to the right may have been meant for a priest
or a “tecuhtli” knight.</p>

<p>We are in full carnival, the entire population parading the
streets in ludicrous travesties, making merry with music, jokes,
and quips. The Señoritas come to our fonda to get subscribers
for the dance; we give our names and follow the stream. The
ball is kept up with much vigour, and Julian is soon in great
requisition by all the pretty Señoritas, to the annoyance and
mortification of Lucian, who ends, however, by declaring that he
can well forgive his success, for he is an obliging fellow and such
a hand at polishing his boots. These words are drowned in the
tumult and cries of the dancers pressing round a man who has
just been shot by his less favoured rival. The would-be
murderer is taken to the police station, while his victim is conveyed
home by his friends and the ball goes on more briskly
than ever.</p>

<p>At last a steamer bound for the Usumacinta is in sight. We
get on board with alacrity, and are soon at Jonuta; but here
the captain, on seeing the low ebb of the river, declares that his
ship cannot go any further. After much parley he is persuaded
to go on, but we are startled by a tremendous bump in the middle
of the night, and find that we are stranded. We wait for the day,
when, with a great deal of difficulty, we succeed in getting her
off, and push on to Monte-Cristo, where the captain <i>nolens volens</i>
lands us, protesting that his ship cannot go another yard. But
our troubles do not end here. We are requested to show our
passes, and as Monte-Cristo is not mentioned, we are in danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">Pg 421</a></span>
of having the whole of our property confiscated. Fortunately
I had a letter from the Home Minister, recommending me to all
the authorities of the Republic. I took it to the Mayor, who gave
me full leave to continue my journey unmolested.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">TERRA-COTTA IDOLS OF TABASCO.</p></div>

<p>And now we turn our thoughts how to get to Tenosiqué;
we find that it takes four or five days by water, and some
twenty-four hours by land. We procure a canoa, in which
we deposit our baggage, under the management of our faithful
Julian, who will follow as quickly as possible, while Lucian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">Pg 422</a></span>
and I, with a guide, take the road through the woods. We
are soon left behind, and do not see our guide again until
six hours later, when we find him reposing by the side of
a running stream.</p>

<p>“Where is our lunch?” I roared out.</p>

<p>“What lunch?”</p>

<p>“Why, the parcel we put up before we started.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I didn’t know what it was, and I left it behind.”</p>

<p>Expostulations were more than vain, and we had to satisfy
the cravings of hunger with a draught of rum and water!</p>

<p>We press on as best we may, and some hours later we
reach a rancho where fresh eggs, poultry, and a beverage
made of Indian corn, somewhat restore our jaded frames.
Here we cross the river on to the right side, and arrive at
Cabecera early in the evening, and put up at two old dames’,
who regale us with chicken broth and fried fish, which, seasoned
by hunger, we find delicious. The next day early we are
at Tenosiqué, three miles distant, where we take up our
quarters in a vacant hut, but, do what we will in the way
of scraping and sweeping, we cannot get rid of mosquitoes,
garrapatas, and other insects, which eat us alive. As to
the food, an old man does his best, and I still remember
that to give us some salad he had recourse to turnip-leaves;
these naturally enough were hard to the bite, and hardly
improved with bitter orange juice by way of vinegar. But
the dearth of any green food made us gulp it down with a
will to like it, and we almost succeeded.</p>

<p>This poor hamlet dates back to 1535, when a Spaniard,
Don Gil by name, settled here. It seems to have kept its
native character to the present day; for Don Saturnino tells
me, that thirty years ago it had still a cacique, “tropiles” (subs),
and a picoté. Of late it has acquired some importance, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">Pg 423</a></span>
its being the great <i>entrepôt</i> of ebony wood, sought for in the
remotest parts of the State.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-423.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="A BIT OF TENOSIQUÉ." />
<p class="caption">A BIT OF TENOSIQUÉ.</p></div>

<p>We hear the most conflicting reports with regard to the
ruins I wish to explore, lying some fifty miles distant on
the other side of the Sierra, on the left bank of the
Usumacinta. They were visited twelve years ago by the
mayor of this place, “<i>when they were still held in high esteem
by the Lacandones</i>. A guard was placed over the temples
and on stated days religious ceremonies were performed, but
since the fall of a favourite idol, whose head lies now among
the rubbish, the building has been abandoned.” Cheered by
this piece of good news, I direct all my energies to procure
men, mules, and horses; the former we obtain with the
promise of double pay, as for the latter we have to wait
for their return from Peten. But when they arrive at last
and I see their wretched condition, and the ghastly wounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">Pg 424</a></span>
which cover them, I feel great misgivings as to their performing
the arduous journey which is in store for them.
Their owner assures me that with a week’s rest the animals
will be all right. I must needs accept his word for it, hoping
the best, for there is nothing else to be done.</p>

<p>To reach the ruins, a space of some five leagues of forest
will have to be cleared on the right side of the river, which will
take us opposite the ruins, but a canoe must likewise be made
to ferry us across. For this purpose I despatch some men in
advance, while we fill up the weary time of waiting by trying
to catch some fish. Curiously enough, a number of sea-fish is
found here in the Usumacinta, 100 miles from its mouth; and
when swollen by rain it brings from distant Guatemala large
quantities of lobsters, together with pumice stones.</p>

<p>We set out on the 15th of March, 1882, and are soon in a
tangle of wood and beset with obstacles of every kind; while
the mules get unloaded, go astray, tarry in green pastures, and
are altogether very troublesome.</p>

<p>We have left behind us the low marshy level, and are nearing
the Cordillera, bearing to the south-east on the Peten road.
The forest seems absolutely interminable with magnificent cedar
and palm-trees, over 100 feet high, the trunks of which almost
disappear under flowering lianas, while the broad-leaved Palmyra
palms commingle with Brazil wood, and form boundless domes of
verdure. It would be pleasant enough could one get used to
being eaten up by mosquitoes and garrapatas. The stations
where we encamp, although not possessed even of a hut, are
carefully marked in the maps for the benefit of muleteers;
they are always on rising ground, in the vicinity of water and
ramon for the animals, their staple food on the march. Our
day’s journey has told already on them; the men disperse to
cut down ramon. Julian is putting up our camp-beds, while cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">Pg 425</a></span>
is busy with our supper, which usually consists of a kind of
Scotch broth, made of dried meat, rice, and black beans, a
round of biscuit, and a cup of coffee, except on days when our
larder has been replenished on the way by a wild duck, a peccari,
and sometimes a monkey!</p>

<p>In the evening the men, grouped round the fire, indulge in
a social weed, while recounting adventures more or less authentic,
then we all retire behind our mosquito curtains and rest our
weary limbs on soft green leaves. Our slumbers are often
interrupted by the roar of the wild beast, the plaintive cries
of nocturnal birds, and howling monkeys. We rise before daybreak,
and what with breakfast, saddling and loading our animals,
the sun is high on the horizon before we can continue our
journey. No incident breaks the wearisome monotony of our
progress, but towards noon I notice to our right traces of
buildings, vast esplanades, the stone edges of which are still
intact, whilst the guide says that towards the valley of S. Pedro,
to our left, are entire monuments still standing—the town of
Izancanac, perhaps. Indeed, the whole country is covered with
ruins, to study which a lifetime were not too long.</p>

<p>The region is full of the memory of the conqueror. He must
have travelled this very road on his march to Honduras. It
was in these woods that, under pretext of a conspiracy, he caused
Guatemozin to be executed. The young Aztec prince displayed
the intrepid spirit of his better days; he reproached Cortez for
his want of faith, protesting the while his innocence. A tardy
monument has just been raised to the upholder of Indian
independence in that Tenochtitlan which he defended as long
as there was stone upon stone, whilst not even a bust marks
the presence of his murderer.</p>

<p>The region we now traverse, covered with immense forests,
was cultivated and inhabited before the Conquest; great cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">Pg 426</a></span>
rose in this trackless labyrinth, the vestiges of which have been
noticed by us, whilst frequent mention of them is found in various
authors. On this route Cortez saw “a great city,” with strong
buildings of stone on the summits of mounds, just as at the present
day. This city, known as “Bitza,” had been abandoned on the
approach of the Spaniards, but provisions of all kinds were left.
When its inhabitants returned, Cortez asked why they had fled.</p>

<p>“Because we were afraid.”</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of all these provisions? Why are
all the crops gathered in?”</p>

<p>“Because if the Lacandones, with whom we are at feud,
had come and conquered us, we would have done away with
everything to starve them out. But on the contrary had we
prevailed, we would have given hot pursuit and lived at their
expense.”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p>Next Cortez passed a town, the environs of which were
peopled with deer so tame, that the Spaniards could catch them
by riding after them.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> The country must, therefore, have been
open to allow of the Spanish cavaliers giving chase.</p>

<p>Cogolludo calls the region between Yucatan, Chiapas, and
Guatemala, <i>Prospero</i>, and says: “The natives of Prospero have
their ears and nostrils bored; they wear in the latter a vanilla pod
or a carved piece of wood; their hair, of which they are vain, is
worn long and adorned with feathers; they also practise tattooing.
They told father Simon that the country round was more densely
populated than Yucatan, that they went by the name of <i>Locenes</i>,
which means <i>apart</i>, and spoke the Maya language; that the other
tribes were the Mopanes, Lacandones, Ahabes, Cihaches, Chinamitas,
etc.; that the town of Locen numbered eight hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">Pg 427</a></span>houses; that the inhabitants were known for their clear complexion,
their good looks; that they wore gold collars round
their necks; and, finally, that many ancient buildings with stone
idols in them, were found in the Sierra.”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile our journey becomes more and more harassing;
we have been obliged to leave one of the horses and a mule to
the jaguars, and not to overload the others, Lucian and I ride
in turn the only remaining horse. We cross the Arroyo
Yalchilan<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> on the Guatemala border, not far from Locen, and
leaving the Peten road, we steer to the south-east-south, on the
path cleared by our men, and encamp on the bank of the running
stream in which we lave our dust-travelled limbs.</p>

<p>The next day we climb the range of hills which divide us from
the upper Usumacinta, and which are almost impassable for loaded
animals. The sharp stones destroy the leather of our boots, and
cut the mules’ feet to pieces, while we are in danger of being lost
down the ravines and precipices. The better to ease the mules’
backs, we leave here such provisions as we shall not require, for
game will not be wanting on our way, and everything will be
safe until we return. A scaffolding supported on poles fixed to
the ground is made, on which wine, biscuit, salt meat, and beans
are deposited.</p>

<p>Here we encamp for the night—the sixth since we left
Tenosiqué—and the next day we begin the ascent of Mirador
and Aguila; the latter, although not more than 1,300 to 1,400 feet
in height, is exceedingly steep and arduous. We meet an old
montero, Don P. Mora, who left his native village three months
since, and is living in the Sierra with two Indians, whose
business is to mark mahogany trees ready for the market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">Pg 428</a></span></p>

<p>Don Pépé has built himself a hut on the Chotal river; he
shoots whatever comes within the range of his muzzle, for
the support of himself and his companions. The poor old
fellow is reduced to a deplorable state by marsh fever; he
volunteers some valuable hints, which I repay with a glass
of wine and a few cigars.</p>

<p class="caption">THE USUMACINTA AT PASO YALCHILAN.</p></div>

<p>Some hours more and we reach the broad level, and set
up our tents on the Chotal, a tributary of the Usumacinta.
The forest round is teeming with life; parrots and aras fill
the air with their shrill cries, yellow-crested hoccos<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> move
silently among the higher branches, while howling monkeys
peer inquisitively at us, and herds of wild boars rush madly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">Pg 429</a></span>past us. We are in the country of the Lacandones; here
and there traces of cultivation are still visible, and huts which
have been abandoned on the approach of timber merchants,
plainly show that they were inhabited not long ago. We
raise our “camp,” <i>en route</i> for the Yalchilan Pass, and arrive
in the evening on the right bank of the Usumacinta.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paso Yalchilan</span> is a geographical point, meaning any given
place on the right bank of the Usumacinta, dividing Mexico
from Guatemala. We reached it so late that we had barely
time to unload our animals and get them some fodder before
the night set in. But now I discovered that the mule carrying
the material for our squeezes had lagged behind; but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">Pg 431</a></span>
too dark, the men declared, to go hunting for him in the insecure
forest, next morning would be time enough. In the night we
were rather startled by cries of “Al tigre! al tigre!” (the tiger).
It turned out to be only a jaguar, but it served to remind us to
keep a fire burning. The next day some of the men set to
work at our cabins, whilst others went in quest of the wretched
mule, which they found almost dead with fatigue and want of
food. They also brought to the general larder a nice young
boar, which was received with joyful shouts, immediately cut
up, roasted, and eaten at our mid-day meal down to the last
morsel.</p>

<p>Our shots brought the canoeros I had sent in advance to
construct a canoe. My inquiries as to the work done were met
with the unsatisfactory answer that nothing was finished; they
had been unlucky in the choice of timber, etc. I immediately
set out to see how it was, and to my great annoyance I found
that hardly any progress had been made. In fact, the men
had taken it mighty easy, had lived like lords on the supplies
I had given them, varying their fare with fish from the river
and game from the forest; causing me a delay which might
ruin my expedition, for our supplies would not last out if this
was the way they went to work. I was returning with head
downcast, looking at the broad river, here over 500 feet
across, pondering on the distance which divided me from the
goal of my expedition, when I spied ahead of us a boat manned
by a Lacandon, who on perceiving us veered quickly round.
Fortunately one of our men spoke Maya; he hailed the man,
promising him a great reward if he would steer towards us. He
came to our encampment, and when I heard that he was a chief,
I showed him the presents I had brought, telling him they would
be his and any of his people’s he should bring to me. We learnt
that he had two more canoes he was willing to let us have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">Pg 432</a></span>
for a consideration, and I congratulated myself on being able to
attain my end so easily.</p>

<p>We were now waiting with some impatience for the cayucoes,
when a large canoe manned by three white men loomed in the
distance; a horrible suspicion flashed across my mind, that they
were men belonging to another expedition, who had forestalled
me. The canoe came near, and I learnt that they had been on
a foray expedition among the Lacandones, but had been unable
to obtain anything except a few tomatoes, and were now returning
to the ruins to join their master, Don Alvaredo, and that their
provisions were running very short.</p>

<p>“Have you another canoe?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, much larger than this.”</p>

<p>“Look here, my good fellows, take my card to your master
with my compliments, together with half a wild pig, salt meat,
rice, biscuits, and in return ask him to lend me his large
canoe, which these men I send with you will bring.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">LACANDON CHIEF AND LACANDON TYPES.</p></div>

<p>The strangers rowed away, and I began to prepare for the
next day’s expedition, in which Lucian and six men would
accompany me, leaving the rest behind to take care of our
heavy luggage under the superintendence of Julian. But in the
morning early I had a severe attack of malaria, which threatened
at one time to delay our journey. A few hours’ rest, however,
and a good dose of quinine, restored me sufficiently to allow of
my setting out for the long-sought, long wished-for ruins, which
we reached in three hours, landing near an enormous pile of
stones—a kind of votive pillar—rising on the left bank of the
river, which has withstood the buffeting of the waters for several
centuries. This stone mound was described to me at Tenosiqué,
as having formed part of an old bridge which spanned the river
at this point. But what we know of the natives’ method of
building makes this supposition impossible, for the river is too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">Pg 433</a><br /><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">Pg 434</a><br /><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">Pg 435</a></span>broad, and on the other hand, had a bridge formerly stood here,
remains would be found either on the opposite side or in the
bed of the river. There is very little doubt that for all the
purposes of daily life, the inhabitants of this city used “canoas”
just as they do now.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-435.jpg" width="500" height="415" alt="VOTIVE PILE OF LORILLARD." />
<p class="caption">VOTIVE PILE OF LORILLARD.</p></div>

<p>We had made but a short way among the ruins lying in every
direction, when we were met by Don Alvaredo, whose fair looks
and elastic step showed him to be an Englishman. We shook
hands; he knew my name, he told me his: Alfred Maudslay,
Esq., from London; and as my looks betrayed the inward
annoyance I felt:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">Pg 436</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he said; “there is no reason why you
should look so distressed. My having had the start of you was
a mere chance, as it would have been mere chance had it been
the other way. You need have no fear on my account, for I
am only an amateur, travelling for pleasure. With you the case
of course is different. But I do not intend to publish anything.
Come, I have had a place got ready; and as for the ruins I
make them over to you. You can name the town, claim to
have discovered it, in fact do what you please. I shall not
interfere with you in any way, and you may even dispense
with mentioning my name if you so please.”</p>

<p>I was deeply touched with his kind manner, and I am only
too charmed to share with him the glory of having explored
this city. We lived and worked together like two brothers, and
we parted the best friends in the world.</p>

<p>This town, which I shall call “Lorillard,” in honour of the
munificent man who partly defrays the cost of the expedition,
rises on the left bank of the Usumacinta in the 17th degree lat.
(see <a href="#i437">Map</a>), in a region hitherto unclassified, between Guatemala,
Chiapas, and Tabasco. (We are able to determine approximately
its position from the bearings we took along our
route.)</p>

<p>It was discovered twelve years ago by Suarez of Tenosiqué,
and has been visited at different times by monteros and by
Balay de Palisada. It has been called “Phantom city,” from
a passage in Stephens’ Journal,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> in which he reproduces a conversation
with the merry “Cura” of Santa Cruz del Quiché, who
told of “a great Indian city four days’ journey from Santa
Cruz, on the road to Mexico, as being densely populated, and
in the same condition as other places of Central America. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">Pg 437</a></span>had heard of it at Chayul many years before, where he had
ascended the Sierra, whence the vast panorama of Yucatan and
Tabasco to the sea could easily be distinguished, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">Pg 438</a></span>
had seen in the far distance a city occupying an immense space,
its white towers shining in the sun.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i437" id="i437"></a>
<img src="images/illus-437.jpg" width="500" height="692" alt="MAP TAKEN FROM THE GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY." />
<p class="caption">MAP TAKEN FROM THE GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY.</p></div>

<p>I do not think that this mysterious city, if ever it was in
existence, is Lorillard, for its bearings do not agree with those
of the American traveller; but there are many others in the
forests, and monteros may come upon palaces which will answer
the description of the “cura,” who assured Stephens that “the
palaces of Santa Cruz del Quiché, which in 1841 were found
in an advanced state of dilapidation, were in a perfect state of
preservation thirty years before, and that they had reminded
him of the buildings of his own country; that at Coban, in the
province of Vera Paz, stood an ancient city (Utatlan) as large
as Vera Cruz, now deserted, but almost as perfect as when
its inhabitants had abandoned it. He had walked in the silent
streets, among its colossal buildings, and found its palaces as
entire as those at Vera Cruz.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p>The number of buildings in good preservation at Lorillard
was supposed to be twelve, of which six were “casas cerradas,”
and six without doors. Balay in his ground plan places
monuments on the right bank of the river, these we were
unable to discover; but we found more than twelve monuments
on the left bank, three or four of which are still standing, having
no trace of doors, just like those at Palenque where they were
also supposed to exist. Owing to the distance from all inhabited
centres and the luxurious vegetation which overruns these ruins,
a complete exploration of them is almost impossible. Their
extent is not known; but to judge from other Indian centres,
the number of the monuments may be estimated at fifteen or
twenty, consisting as usual of temples, palaces, and the huts
of the lower orders. These buildings, some 65 feet distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">Pg 439</a></span>from the river, are like those at Palenque, supported on terraces
rising in amphitheatre and resting on natural hills, which the
builders made use of to save labour. They are, as usual, faced
with stones, have a central flight of steps, but they are fewer,
of smaller dimensions, and not so richly decorated as similar
edifices at Palenque; but the materials employed, the inner
decorations, the figures on the bas-reliefs with retreating foreheads,
are the same, although more rudely built. The outline,
however, resembles some of the Yucatec structures. It should
be remarked that it is difficult to give a correct description of
these monuments, for all trace of outer decoration has disappeared.</p>

<p>The first monument we study—of which a drawing and a
ground plan are given—is a temple. It stands at a distance of
487 feet from the river, on a mound about 120 feet high. I call
it temple because it contains a great stone idol and niches which
must have supported other idols, and that the walls are black
from the smoke of offerings. The idol’s head is lopped off, and
lies amidst the rubbish; the face is completely mutilated, which
seems to show that in the frequent inter-tribal wars, the town was
taken and plundered, the temple demolished, and the vanquished
gods destroyed. This we see in the Mexican manuscripts, where
the defeat of a nation is always represented by a small edifice
with a prominent cornice, which is entered by the invader
a lighted torch in his hand.</p>

<span class="caption">IDOL IN LACANDON TEMPLE.</span></span>
But when was Lorillard destroyed? I think Villa Gutierre
Soto Mayor<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> gives us an approximate date when he
says: “That the Iztaes of Peten were at enmity with the
Lacandones; that in 1694—two years before the fall of the
city by the Spaniards—the
former were
making expeditions
with fleets of canoes
on the Usumacinta
and Rio Tabasco,
and that they plundered
and destroyed
the towns situated on
the river.” But if
we follow Boyle,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> the
destruction of Lorillard
would be much
later, for we read:
“The Lacandones
are of the same race
as the <i>Manchus</i> and
very numerous; they
<i>were quite civilised a
hundred and fifty
years ago</i>” (1730).</p>

<p class="caption">FIRST TEMPLE AT LORILLARD CITY.</p></div>

<p>This idol is very
beautiful and unique of its kind, for nothing like it has been
found either in Tabasco or Yucatan. It represents a figure
sitting cross-legged, the hands resting on the knees. The
attitude is placid and dignified, like a Buddha statue; the face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">Pg 441</a><br /><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">Pg 442</a><br /><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">Pg 443</a></span>now mutilated, is crowned by an enormous head-dress, of peculiar
style, presenting a fantastic head with a diadem and medallions,
topped by huge feathers like those on the columns at
Tula and Chichen-Itza. The bust is admirably proportioned;
while the dress consists of a rich cape embroidered with pearls,
a medallion on each shoulder and in front, recalling Roman
decorations. The same ornamentation is seen on the lower
part of the body, having a much larger medallion and a fringed
maxtli. The arms are covered with heavy bracelets. Round
the idol, and in every apartment of the building, are a number
of bowls of coarse clay of some 4 or 6 inches in diameter by
2 inches in height. The borders are ornamented with masks
representing faces with flat or aquiline noses, utterly devoid
of artistic feeling. Nevertheless <i>the difference of type is noteworthy</i>,
and may point to <i>two different races</i>. These bowls
were used as censers, for some are still filled with copal. Our
cut shows two specimens. Similar bowls are found in all the
buildings which were used as temples.</p>

<p class="caption">LACANDON VASES FOUND AT LORILLARD CITY.</p></div>

<p>This temple is pierced by three openings, with stone lintels
fairly carved; its facade is about 68 feet by 19 feet 6 inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">Pg 444</a></span>
long, its height to the decorative wall is 17 feet to 19 feet;
the latter, of lattice-work, is 14 feet high, and recalls similar
structures at Kabah, and more particularly the Pigeon House
at Uxmal. The decoration must have been very rich, for in
the central upper wall is a large panel which was occupied by
a figure sitting on a bench which is still standing. The masonry
which formed the body of the statue is yet visible, while a narrow
long stone to the right formed the shin-bone of the figure’s
left leg; a method of working which we pointed out at Palenque,
Izamal, and Aké, and called the “cement epoch.” Below in the
great frieze forming the body of the edifice, three large panels
were also occupied by statues, which were still standing. In
the central panel to the right, the masonry which formed the
bodies before the fall of the plaster is still visible; while eight
niches, in groups of two each, contained idols of smaller dimensions.</p>

<p>On the first esplanade of the pyramid is another building,
which to judge from its inner arrangement was the priest’s
house. This temple is neither stately nor ancient, for hardly
any rubbish has accumulated at the foot of the building.</p>

<p>We give here the drawing of a diminutive ancient temple in
terra-cotta, to be seen in the Trocadéro, and which we found on
the <i>Uplands of Mexico</i>. It consists of a pyramid with three or
four stories, and a temple crowning its summit, with projecting
cornices surmounted by a decorative wall, pierced by holes
exactly like the temple at Lorillard, at Tikal, and the Pigeon
House at Uxmal. The most prejudiced mind cannot but acknowledge
the resemblance and similarity of design in the
religious architecture of the plateaux, and that of Chiapas,
Tabasco, Yucatan, and Guatemala.</p>

<p>To the rear of the temple, on a much higher pyramid, stands
the loftiest and largest monument at Lorillard. On its vast
esplanade were six palaces, forming a rectangle. One of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">Pg 445</a></span>
palaces, having stone lintels finely sculptured, is still partly
standing, but so decayed that we could do nothing with it. As
for the other buildings, they are a ruinous heap. The narrow
openings had stone lintels, while those of the large entrances
were of wood; this was probably owing to the difficulty of procuring
blocks of stone of sufficient size for the main doorways.
Remains of wooden lintels and zapoté wood are still found in
the walls. This building, whether it was the cacique’s residence
<span class="figright200" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus-445.jpg" width="200" height="291" alt="MODEL OF ANCIENT TEMPLE." />
<span class="caption">MODEL OF ANCIENT TEMPLE.</span></span>
or a fortress, is admirably situated,
and from the upper terrace
a magnificent view extending
over boundless woodlands is
obtained. It should be borne in
mind that in an unhealthy, burning
climate, dwellings on the
summits of pyramids were a
necessity for health, pure air,
absence of mosquitoes and other
disagreeable insects; that is the
reason why we invariably find
buildings of any dimensions supported
on mounds and terraces.</p>

<p>The palace we inhabit is
below the temple and on the first grade of the hill or amphitheatre.
What remains of its decorations is like that of the
temple, but ruder and more dilapidated. The doors are
irregular, of different size, with slanting or perpendicular jambs
and niches distributed without any order. The decorative wall
which crowned the building has fallen in; the frieze is but
a confusion of holes, niches, and projecting stones. The inner
arrangement is rather peculiar, being a maze of narrow passages,
small apartments having platforms of masonry covered over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">Pg 446</a></span>
with plaster, which may have been used as beds. Another long
narrow platform, occupying the centre of the main passage,
we thought was the dining-room, and was used as such. To the
rear, in a subterraneous portion which is reached by a very steep
passage, are two narrow apartments filled up to the ceiling, which
were probably tombs. They reminded me of similar chambers at
Palenque, in which I found skeletons and vases.</p>

<p>The façade of this building is 65 feet by 52 feet long. Two
fragments of sculptured columns, about 2 feet in height, the use
of which is not known, but which may have been altars supporting
household gods, or pediments for censers, are found in the front
yard. On clearing the edifice of its vegetation, I found that the
average of concentric circles, showing the age of the trees, were
ten or twelve a year, just as at Palenque.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">Pg 447</a></span></p>

<p>I may remark that virgin forests have no very old trees,
being destroyed by insects, moisture, lianas, etc.; and old
monteros tell me that mahogany and cedar-trees, which are most
durable, do not live above 200 years. In our passage through
the forest, even on days when there was not a breath of wind,
trees were falling in every direction. In a storm they fall about
in hundreds, and the journey is then most dangerous. Monuments
cannot be gauged, therefore, from the size of the trees
growing in and over them. Another feature of virgin forests
is that they do not strike the mind as anything particular, and
I know none which can at all compare with Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>To the south-west of our residence is another great pyramid,
having circular buildings, which must have been a temple, for
we found a great number of vases for perfumes, both on the
ground floor and in the upper portion of the edifice. The body
of the monument is of the usual type, but the first story (a side
of which is shown in our cut) affords a new specimen of the
Indian mode of building. We think this but an extension of
the decorative wall; it consists of a narrow apartment and a
receding passage extending from end to end, terminating at each
extremity with the peculiar opening seen in our drawing.</p>

<p>We have also noticed a greater variety in the triangular vaults
(arches) of these buildings, which are either straight, concave, or
convex; sometimes the latter vault has no key, and the two walls
meet with an acute angle, whereas in Tabasco and Yucatan, they
are straight or concave only. Lintels are more numerous and
richly sculptured than in Yucatan, but they are only found in
edifices which we suppose were temples or palaces. The best
carved are small, and seem to replace both the slabs covered with
inscriptions, the rear of altars, and the sculptured pillars of the
buildings at Palenque.</p>

<p>The first we give occupies the central door of the temple, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">Pg 448</a></span>
is 3 feet 9 inches long, by 2 feet 10 inches wide. Two figures
with retreating foreheads form the main subject, having the usual
high head-dress of feathers, cape, collar, medallion, and maxtli
like the idol; while their boots are fastened on the instep with
leather strings, as similar figures at Palenque. They are of
different size, and represent probably a man and a woman per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">Pg 449</a></span>forming
a religious ceremony; the taller holds in each hand a
Latin cross, while the other carries but one in the right hand.
Rosettes form the branches of the crosses, a symbolic bird crowns
the upper portion, whilst twenty-three katunes are scattered about
the bas-relief. We think this a symbolic representation of Tlaloc,
whose chief attribute was a cross, which here consists of palms
or more probably maize-leaves intermingled with human figures,
recalling to the memory of his devotees the god who presided
over harvests.</p>

<p class="caption">SCULPTURED LINTEL AT LORILLARD.</p></div>

<p>The two high reliefs which follow are also lintels from a small
ruined edifice at the foot of the pyramid, of great interest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">Pg 450</a></span>
marvellous richness of detail, than which nothing at Palenque is
so minute. The first represents two human figures surrounded
by a snake or volute, the centre of which is occupied by a cartouche
containing four hieroglyphics. The figure to the left
holding a sceptre in his right hand, with an aigret in his huge
head-dress, similar to that in the palace at Palenque, may be a
king, or more probably a priest of Quetzalcoatl. Both figures
wear the usual dress, but the priest’s medallion is a gem of art.
The inscription, half of which is in a good state of preservation,
is a series of characters mixed with the human figures, like
the inscriptions in Chiapas and Tabasco. We think these two
figures portray a ceremony in honour of Quetzalcoatl; for in the
First Part of the Troano manuscript (Plate XXVI.) as well as in
the Second (Plate XVII.), which are obviously dedicated to this
deity, we find figures resembling that on our slab. It is by far the
most wonderful monument which, up to the present time, has been
found in America, and which we can boldly call a work of art.
If we except the flat foreheads, everything is perfect in this
monument; and nothing in the early manifestations of ancient
civilisations is found more rich or better treated than this; as
seen in the hands, the head-dress, the superb mantle of the
kneeling figure, the dignified, majestic mien of the standing priest.</p>

<p class="caption">STONE LINTEL, SACRIFICE TO CUKULCAN, LORILLARD CITY.</p></div>

<p>We said that this relief, and the edifice to which it belongs,
were dedicated to Cukulcan, representing a religious ceremony,
or rather sacrifice; for the kneeling priest has a rope passed
through his tongue, whilst the other holds over him a huge
palm, encouraging him to go on with his penance, and this is
corroborated by Sahagun, who says:<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> “They pierced a hole
with a sharp itzli knife through the middle of the tongue, and
passed a number of twigs, according to the degree of devotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">Pg 451</a><br /><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">Pg 452</a><br /><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">Pg 453</a></span>of the performer. These twigs were sometimes fastened the one
to the other and pulled through the tongue like a long cord.
They were also passed through a hole in the ear, and other parts
of the body; but wherever they were passed, four hundred and
even more were used by the penitent, which done, his sins were
forgiven.”</p>

<p>Torquemada also mentions these penances: “The priests
of Camaxtli and Cholula, <i>i.e.</i> of Quetzalcoatl, under the superintendence
of their elder, or <i>achcautli</i>, provided themselves with
sticks two feet long and the size of the fist, and with them they
repaired to the main temple, where they fasted five days. Then
carpenters and tool-workers were brought, who were required to
fast the same number of days, at the end of which they were
given food within the precincts of the temple. The former worked
the sticks to the required size, whilst the tool-makers made knives
of obsidian, with which they cut the priest’ tongues from side to
side.</p>

<p>“More prayers followed, when all the priests prepared for the
sacrifice, the elders giving the example by passing through their
tongue four or five hundred twigs, followed by such among the
young who has sufficient courage to imitate them. But the
pain was so sharp that few went through the whole number; for
although the first twigs were thinned out, they became stouter
each time, until they attained the size of a thumb, sometimes
twice as much. Not unfrequently the <i>achcautli</i> sang a hymn
during this horrible operation, to encourage his younger companions
in the pursuance of their duty. The <i>achcautli</i> was wont
also to go about admonishing the people to prepare for the
great feast (sacrifices), and in <i>his hand was carried a large green
twig</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> This green twig was replaced by a palm in warm regions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">Pg 454</a></span>as in our relief, the leaves of which rest on the double volute
so often seen about Quetzalcoatl’s mouth.</p>

<p>We read in Clavigero that: “The blood which flowed from
these self-inflicted wounds was carefully kept on the leaves of
a plant called <i>acxoyatl</i>, having a number of straight stalks and
large leaves growing symmetrically.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> Is there no connection
between this plant and the palm of our figure?</p>

<p>Landa too relates that these macerations were common to
the Mexican and Maya priests: “The Mayas offered their blood
to the gods, cutting their ears all round and allowing the bits
to hang down; sometimes they pierced their cheeks, their lower
lip, or their tongue, and passed twigs through them.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>And at page 9 of Letellier’s “Codex,” in the National Library,
we find opposite the image of Cukulcan, a painting representing
a priest, passing <i>a number of twigs through his tongue</i>, whilst the
blood is flowing freely.</p>

<p>We have seen that one of the attributes of Cukulcan was
the cross, a symbol of rain, the fertilising element. “The cross,”
says Brinton, “is the symbol of the four winds; the bird and
serpent, the rebus of the air god (Quetzalcoatl) their ruler.”<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> This
god was therefore intimately connected with Tlaloc and his sister
or mate Chalchiutlicue, and that is why the three deities are often
found side by side, sometimes mixed or confused, owing probably
to their festival falling on the same day.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> The cult of Quetzalcoatl
and Tlaloc was spread by the Toltecs in their long wanderings;
consequently we find them at Lorillard just as we did on the
plateaux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">Pg 455</a></span></p>

<p>We discovered in another temple two inscriptions on stone
lintels, like all the other bas-reliefs at Lorillard, resembling
those given by Stephens at Chichen and Copan, rather than
those which accompany the figures. We place them side by
side in the next chapter, to enable the reader to judge for himself.
This is not the first time we have pointed out a difference
between the characters of the various inscriptions we have published;
but a difference does not imply dissimilarity, and can in
no way invalidate their common origin. If we look at home we
shall find that the writing of the nations of Europe has been
greatly modified, and that the Gothic characters of the twelfth
century bear no resemblance to the Roman type of the sixteenth.
These inscriptions may belong to different epochs or different
dialects, and we have reason to believe that the Toltecs of
Central America had a hieratic writing which was used both
by the priests and the military caste, of which proof exists in
the bas-reliefs and the stone inscriptions, where the figures are
represented sitting cross-legged, whereas in the inscriptions
which we suppose to be in the vulgar tongue, and also in
the paper manuscripts, the figures are squatting, their chin
resting on their knees Indian fashion. There is a third
writing, or symbolical character, which was used in the Aztec
manuscripts, and also in Toltec and Aztec sculptures, to denote
a man or a place; as seen on the tribal leaves published
by Lorenzana, on Tizoc’s stone, and on the bas-reliefs at
Chichen-Itza.</p>

<p>We do not know Toltec writing, for the manuscripts which
were read by Ixtlilxochitl, those found by Boturini, and interpreted
by Veytia (so he affirms), have disappeared; but it is
probable that their current writing has been preserved on the
stone tables of Central America, where it was used as a hieratic
or learned language, of which the Dresden and Troano MSS. are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">Pg 456</a></span>
specimens, but that they adopted the language of the regions
where they established themselves.</p>

<p>Egypt had three kinds of writing; and in the inscriptions of
the far East found at Ciampa, Mr. Aymonier has discovered a
hieratic, an ancient vulgar language, and a dialect in common
use at the present day.</p>

<p>Our work at Lorillard is done; and it is high time that we
should change our quarters, for Lucian, my secretary, is in a
deplorable condition, brought about by the too searching garrapatas
and other insects. The poor fellow is one sore from the
waist, and it is a perfect wonder how he held out so long. He
is unable to stand, and has to be carried on board our boat bound
for “Paso Yalchilan.”</p>

<p>I quit this newly-found city with deep regret, leaving a great
deal unexplored, and treasures, maybe, as priceless as our
Quetzalcoatl bas-relief. The care of making a complete ground
plan of the place, and bringing to light the monuments said to exist
on the right bank of the river, must, however, devolve on one
more fortunate than myself.</p>

<p>The day after our arrival at Yalchilan, we received the visit
of the old chief, who was accompanied this time by his two wives
and four young men. I photographed them, and with the interpreter’s
help I succeeded in keeping them fairly quiet. They
all wear the same dress, a kind of loose white tunic reaching to
the ankles, made of coarse calico prepared by the women. That
of the chief and his wives was dotted over with red obtained from
a berry; their hair is worn long and loose, and the women adorn it
with feathers; an enormous collar of berries, beads, bone, and
coins is around their necks, and hangs down to their waist. They
hold great store by their tunics and necklaces, which they would
not be persuaded to part with in favour of European goods; this
does not extend to their bows and arrow-heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">Pg 457</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus-457.jpg" width="350" height="480" alt="SCULPTURED LINTEL AT LORILLARD." />
<p class="caption">SCULPTURED LINTEL AT LORILLARD.</p></div>

<p>The same dress being common to both sexes, makes it sometimes
difficult to distinguish men from women. The old chief
looks sharply after his young wives, and this inclines me to think
that the young fellows who accompany him are bachelors, and
that ladies are scarce in the forest. As a matter of fact, women
are the main cause of their dissensions, and we witness here a
real struggle for selection.</p>

<p>They still use stone implements to fell trees and cultivate the
land, so that on seeing the steel hatchets, knives, and swords I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">Pg 458</a></span>
gave them, the chief exclaimed in the words of the Lystrians:
“These are gods and not men, who give us such wonderful
things.”</p>

<p>The Lacandones wear no beard, and the hair that makes
its appearance is immediately extracted. They are well formed
and of medium size, but their flesh is flabby, their teeth decayed,
and they look anæmic, owing probably to their forest life.
They live on the produce of the chase, fishing, and agriculture.
I am told that their fields are better cultivated than those of the
whites, their cabins neat, and that there is no lack of tobacco,
cotton, maize, and fruit. They have lost many useful arts
which were known to their ancestors, such as pottery, which
they replace by a variety of calabashes; nevertheless, they are
far from being as savage as is supposed. Their cruelty is the
result of their hospitality and confidence having been grossly
abused by the monteros. I could learn nothing respecting their
religion, except that before the discovery of the ruins by the
whites, they used to perform their religious ceremonies in them.
They are extremely diffident, and will hide in the woods at the
approach of strangers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peten</span> can be reached from Yalchilan either by going up the
Usumacinta, which a few hours beyond takes the name of Rio de
la Pasion, or through the woods on the abominable old Indian
road described by every traveller. We elect the latter, which,
although longer, is easier for our men, who will have mules to
carry the heavy baggage.</p>

<p>About noon we come again upon Pépé Mora, who looks
worse than ever; but far from thinking of leaving his post, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">Pg 460</a></span>
has thoughts of founding a colony here, and has begun by
planting orange-trees and red chermoias. He gives us a sac
of smoked dry boar, we tender our thanks and bid good-bye to
the good old fellow, whom in all probability we shall never meet
again, and about four o’clock in the afternoon reach our first
encampment.</p>

<p>The small river which has been our guiding mark is barely
3 feet deep, but its banks are so high and steep that our mules
will only venture in after much coaxing, but once in the stream
they feel so nice and cool that they are persuaded with great
difficulty to leave it. As for the Mariposa entrusted with my
wardrobe, notes, and plates, she laid down and completely disappeared
all but the head. I thought it was all over with my
documents, and was not able to refrain from a cry of horror; it
was a false alarm, which, however, obliged us to spend the best
part of the night round the fires to dry both clothes and photographs.
In the evening we reached the spot where we had left
some of our supplies; everything was exactly as it had been
left, but we could hear nothing of the wretched horse which had
been abandoned.</p>

<p>Next day we took the Peten road, and arrived four days later
at Sacluc, now Libertad, the chief town of Peten, and the last
inhabited place in Guatemala. It is but a wretched village, like
all we have seen in these warm regions; it lacks everything, and
we should literally have starved, but for some clerks, who gave
up to us an azotea (flat roof) and part of their supplies.</p>

<p>Our road led east-south-east up to this point; but now its
direction is north as far as Flores, some thirty miles beyond,
which stands on an islet of the lake of Peten. This road is
not far from the Sacpui lagoon mentioned by Bernal Diaz in
his account of Cortez’ expedition to Honduras, when the
Spaniards “<i>passed a village surrounded by a great lake of fresh</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">Pg 461</a></span>
<i>water</i>. Near it was a river emptying in the lake, which was
used by the Indians to go to the Sacpui lagoon (Chaltuna) and
Tayasal, capital of Peten-Itza.</p>

<p>“The place,” says the veteran soldier, “has white houses
and temples which glitter in the sun and can be seen six
miles distant.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> It is clear that Cortez was on the left bank
of the only important river discharging itself in the lake, for
he dispatched five Spaniards and two Indians in a canoe to
require the cacique of Tayasal to furnish him with boats to
cross the river. It proves also that the march was much
further south than Palenque, and that Izancanac was not
Palenque and still less Lorillard, as advanced by Maler in
the “Bulletin de la Société Géographique, 2<sup>e</sup> trimestre 1884,”
page 275. His assertion is all the more extraordinary that
Diaz’ account shows plainly that Cortez must have gone up the
S. Pedro valley to come upon this place, the only one which
corresponds to Diaz’ map and itinerary.</p>

<p>It is too absurd to suppose that Cortez, who was provided
with a mariner’s compass, whose route lay by Tayasal, should
have abandoned the broad level and eastern direction to turn
south and encounter the stupendous difficulties of crossing the
abrupt range which divides S. Pedro from upper Usumacinta—a
<i>détour</i> of more than ninety miles. In that case he would
have approached the Sacpui lagoon on the southern and not
on the western side, and there would have been no river to
cross. We will give Diaz’ own words:</p>

<p>“The villages towards which we steered were on an islet,
near a fresh-water lake, which could only be reached by canoes.
<i>We walked round two miles and discovered</i> a ford where the
water was up to our waist. Here we got some guides, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">Pg 462</a></span>when Cortez, through Doña Marina, asked them to take us
to the towns inhabited by bearded men, they answered that
they were quite ready to do so. Five accompanied us; and
the road, broad at first, became very narrow, <i>owing to a great
river which discharges itself in an estuary not far distant. Here
the Indians entered their boats to go to the town we were bound
for, called Tayasal.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>The cacique himself came forward and conducted Cortez to
his island, who left his wounded horse Marzillo to the care of
the Indians. They, after the general’s departure, offered him
divine honours and the offerings of their idols, but the invalided
animal got worse under such fare and at last died. The affrighted
Iztaes raised him a temple and placed in it his sculptured image,
worshipping him under the name of <i>Izimin Chac</i> (“thunder and
lightning”), because, having witnessed some of the cavaliers
shooting deer, they imagined that the flash of their guns
proceeded from the animal.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> The name <i>Izimin Chac</i> recalls
the pyramid at Izamal called <i>Papp-hol-Chac</i>, “house of heads
and lightning.”</p>

<p>Flores, our next stage, is a lovely place built on the site
of ancient Tayasal, beautifully situated on a great lake surrounded
by a lofty range of hills. The Spaniards found the Iztaes, who
had come from Yucatan, established here. All marks of sculpture
and architecture have disappeared; nevertheless, we are able
to reconstruct its history and show that the monuments were not
ancient.</p>

<p>When Cortez passed here, the town still numbered among
its inhabitants men who had come with the emigrant column
from Yucatan, and this tradition was current two centuries later.
They had preserved the ancient civilisation of the Toltecs, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">Pg 463</a></span>used the same characters to record their history, which were
handed down on manuscripts called “<i>Analtes</i>,” exemplified in
the Yucatec and Mexican manuscripts.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> “Their idols,” says
P. Fuensalida, “were like those of the peninsula.”</p>

<p>Such writers as Villa Gutierre Soto Mayor, Cogolludo,
and Remesal<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> mention various expeditions sent to subdue this
gallant little people, which was the last to surrender to Spanish
arms.</p>

<p>The expedition from Yucatan was in 1618, two monks taking
part in it to convert the natives. They found at Tayasal the
language, the manners, the customs and architecture of Yucatan
before the Conquest, with a population of 25,000 to 30,000 souls,
which would incline us to infer that the great cities we have
visited were larger and contained more buildings than we thought
possible.</p>

<p>“These temples,” says Cogolludo, “raised as usual on
pyramids, were of the same dimensions as the largest churches
in Yucatan, and were capable of holding over 1,000 persons.
In one of them stood the Izimin Chac, Cortez’ horse, which
seeing, one of the monks, Padre Juan de Orbita, filled with
indignation, rushed at the idol and broke it with a huge stone.”
But this ill-advised zeal well-nigh caused the destruction of the
troop, which was only saved by the friendly interference of the
cacique.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p>There followed a second, then a third expedition under Martin
Ursua (1696), who, on his march to Peten, found a place called
Rohbeccan, “a city with edifices filled with idols.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">Pg 464</a></span></p>

<p>Tayasal was attacked and taken on the 2nd of March, 1696,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>
when the survivors of the struggle retired to the inaccessible
vastnesses of the northern islands, their spirit still unbroken.</p>

<p>The more we advance, the clearer it becomes that if numerous
towns were found deserted, it does not prove their antiquity,
but rather the deep, universal hatred of the natives for the conquerors.
This city had twelve temples in 1618, and twenty-one
in 1696, so that nine were built during the seventeenth century;
among the latter was the finest of all, described by Villa Gutierre
Soto Mayor in the following words: “The great temple was
entirely built of stones, lofty and square in shape, <i>with a fine
balcony</i> of cut stones, and two ogival vaults, each side measuring
20 varas” (about 60 feet).<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> This, we think, disposes of the
<i>prehistoric</i> temples scattered in the forests of the peninsula.</p>

<p>This temple, although more finely built, recalls the Castillo at
Chichen, the chief features of which are reproduced here on a
larger scale. Is not this sufficient proof that the monuments were
modern, and not the work of an extinct race? We find Tayasal
a descendant, a daughter of Chichen-Itza, just as Tikal is its
ascendant or ancestress; the latter will give us the key to the
chief cause of the Toltec migrations in Yucatan, and will explain
the Toltec influence visible in the cities of Coban, Copan, and
Quirigua.</p>

<p>Tikal is forty miles north-east of Flores, towards the south
of the peninsula. Two explorers have visited it of late; one is
the Swiss Bernouilli, whose labours were interrupted by death,
but whose documents upon Tikal are as priceless as they are
interesting. They consist of twelve pieces of sculptured zapoté
wood, which were appropriated from the temples and are now
in the Basle Museum, where I was permitted to take squeezes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">Pg 465</a></span>of them; many are damaged by the infiltration of water rather
than time, nevertheless, a whole panel has been made, which we
reproduce the better to elucidate our explanations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-465.jpg" width="500" height="324" alt="FLORES, LAKE OF PETEN." />
<p class="caption">FLORES, LAKE OF PETEN.</p></div>

<p>The other traveller is Alfred Maudslay, who made Guatemala
the main field of his interesting and successful labours. We
borrow from his photographs and notes to complete our description.
“The buildings at Tikal are of stone laid in mortar <i>smoothed
over with plaster</i> (the cement epoch at Palenque, Lorillard, and
Aké). The walls are generally 3 feet thick; the inner walls
rise perpendicularly to a height of 7 feet, then approach each
other to form the well-known American vault or pointed arch.
No trace of true vaults are found, for the acute angle of the
arch, and the enormous weight pressing on it, would not allow
the walls to be more than 5 or 6 feet distant from each other;
so that the interior of the palaces presents the appearance of
long passages rather than apartments.” (Exactly what we pointed
out at Lorillard.) “The doors are square at the top and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">Pg 466</a></span>
lintels consist of three or four pieces of wood. Within the
apartments are also pieces of the same wood, but smaller, and
placed across the ceiling 5 feet distant from each other.”</p>

<p>Some of these small palaces are in a perfect state of preservation,
but by far the greater proportion, the lintels of which
have disappeared, are a ruinous heap. As usual, the edifices
are reared on natural or artificial plateaux, the sides faced with
cut stones. The most important buildings are the temples,
which rise on high pyramids, the sides divided in receding
ranges or stones, shown in our plate.</p>

<p>The façade is occupied by a flight of steps leading to the
entrance of the temple, which is narrower than the terrace on
which it stands, whilst the side of the pyramid corresponding
to it is on a steeper slope than the façade and remaining sides.
(This we pointed out also at Palenque and Lorillard.) The
pyramid is 184 ft. at the base by 168 ft.; the staircase is 112 ft.
high by 38 ft. wide, giving the pyramid a mean altitude of 90 ft.;
the façade is 41 ft. by 28 ft. long and about 40 ft. high, counting
the <i>decorative wall</i> hidden by vegetation.</p>

<p>All these temples are alike; the characteristic feature about
them is the great thickness of the walls, the niches on the sides
of the main apartment, and the gradual narrowing of the edifice
from front to rear. The interior of each consists of two or
three narrow passages running on a parallel line on the sides
and abutting on the front corridor, with large openings and
wooden lintels beautifully sculptured. The inner walls of the
temples are higher than those of the palaces, whilst the vault,
also higher, forms a more acute angle. This is owing to the
great decorative wall crowning the edifice, the weight of which
would have been excessive, had not the builder provided for it
by thickening the walls, lengthening the vault, and narrowing
the apartment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">Pg 467</a></span></p>

<p>“I met no idol, or any object of veneration in these temples,”
says Maudslay: a pardonable error, since he had not yet visited
Palenque or Lorillard, which would have enabled him to see
in all those pieces of sculptured wood representations of religious
ceremonies, which replaced the idols seemingly wanting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">Pg 468</a></span></p>

<p>“In the open space or court which stands between the temples,
are several stones of the nature of stelæ or small menhirs;
some have their front occupied by a human profile and hieroglyphics
on the sides. On others, both profiles and hieroglyphics
were of very hard cement; the stone had also been smoothed
over with it. In this court are likewise several circular altars,
<i>facsimiles of those at Copan</i>. Some are scattered among the
ruins, but they are generally plain, owing probably to the plaster
that composed the figures having fallen, and left the stone surface
bare. Circular openings of about 1 foot 9 inches in diameter
occupy the centre of the square or court, giving access to
circular subterraneous chambers from 6 feet to 10 feet in diameter.
They were cisterns.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> Our plate shows one of the temples
having these stones in its court.</p>

<p>On comparing the edifices at Lorillard with this temple, it
is seen that the frieze which surmounts the plain wall at the base
must have had the same kind of cemented figures, whilst the
ground plan at Tikal shows the arrangement of its monuments
to have been similar with those at Lorillard. Thus we find at
Tikal a <i>résumé</i> of all that which we noticed and studied in the
various cities we have visited; but here we have a new feature
in the altars, which stand in the open air, whilst the stelæ recall
the votive pillars at Teotihuacan which develop in monoliths at
Copan and Quirigua.</p>

<p>This analogy is plainly seen in our drawing of one of these
stelæ, representing a beautifully sculptured figure, in high relief,
with the usual dress of priests, grandees, and idols. A series
of katunes, like those at Palenque, Lorillard, and Copan, are
ranged on the edge of the stone. Unfortunately this monument
is in a very dilapidated condition; but for the head, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">Pg 469</a></span>wanting, it would have been quite as remarkable as our high
relief at Lorillard (see end of chapter).</p>

<p>If we come to details, a first glance will show that the superb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">Pg 470</a></span>
bas-relief on wood in the next page, is a facsimile of the panels
to the rear of the altars at Palenque. The dimensions are almost
the same, 6 feet high by 7 feet 6 inches wide: it also represents
two figures in high relief, having the peculiar attributes generally
seen on American sculptures. The hieroglyphics on the sides are
admirably well preserved, and do not betoken a very ancient epoch,
for they are just like those at Palenque, Lorillard, and Copan.</p>

<span class="caption">QUETZALCOATL AT COPAN.</span></span>
Unlike similar reliefs at Palenque,
where the idol formed
the central subject, here it is replaced
by a standing human figure,
having an elaborate head-dress
with fantastic ornaments and huge
feathers, recalling Tabasco and
Yucatan. In his hand is carried
a sceptre topped by a bird’s tail,
and the rosette we noticed on the
crosses at Lorillard, whilst his left
arm is almost hidden by a shield;
he wears the usual fringed cape,
heavy collar, and large medallion;
under this is seen a rich mantle
reaching almost to the ground;
garters and buckles are around his legs, and shoes cover his
feet. The Buddhic religious cloak is seen also on the kneeling
priest at Lorillard, and the maniple on the arm is a facsimile
of one in the palace at Kabah.</p>

<img src="images/illus-471.jpg" width="500" height="658" alt="IDOLS OF COPAN (FROM STEPHENS)." />
<p class="caption">IDOLS OF COPAN (FROM STEPHENS).</p></div>

<p>To the right below the inscription are symbolic ornaments,
and towards the lower extremity two superb human profiles.
Under the left inscription is a figure with a monstrous head,
sitting on a stool ornamented with arms, with a back of peculiar
shape. Many of the ornaments on this panel are of unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">Pg 471</a></span>
signification, but a large portion is quite familiar and has been
already reproduced by us. The most important figure of all
is that to the top of the bas-relief, above the central figure.
It is a mask with protruding tongue representing the sun, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">Pg 472</a></span>
that of the Mexican calendar and the central figure over the
altar in the Temple of the Sun at Palenque. The flames on
the sides of the mask indicate this plainly. Clearly this magnificent
bas-relief belonged to a temple dedicated to that great
Toltec deity.</p>

<p>We know that the worship of the sun was general with
all the American tribes, and if at Tikal we call him the god of
one particular race, it is owing to the details which surround
him; both pyramids, temples, inscriptions, figures, and emblems
particularise him, and give us the right to connect him with
the religion of the Uplands and call him Toltec.</p>

<p>We have other panels consisting of scattered pieces collected
in various monuments. Some of the inscriptions are in perfect
condition, and furnish important analogies. One is a human
profile, like the sculptured figures on the great monoliths at
Copan; another has fine inscriptions and a characteristic tiger’s
head, whilst below is a figure of the usual type and dress
sitting on a throne admirably carved. These reliefs are in the
Trocadéro.</p>

<p>To sum up, Tikal is a town which belongs to the Toltec
civilisation, the march of which we have followed from their
first homes to Ocosingo, Lorillard, and Tikal in Yucatan, where
they met, both in the south and north of Guatemala, the first
branch, but Tikal being farthest from the starting-point must
necessarily be younger than the cities already described; to
us, however, it is one of the most important epochs in this
original civilisation, inasmuch as it is an intermediary station,
a place whence the race branched off, a fact which solves
questions and clears up events not hitherto understood.</p>

<p>From Tikal the civilising column advanced towards the north
of the peninsula. Material proofs of this exist in the cities
ranged on its line of march, for instance, Nohbeccan, seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">Pg 473</a></span>
by Ursua, and also in the historical data, which the reader
may see in our chapter on Chichen-Itza.</p>

<p>The uniform expression of the faces in these bas-reliefs is
generally calm and pleasant, as at Palenque, where we pointed
out that after the almost total extermination of their race, the
Toltecs ceased to be a warlike nation and became missionaries
of civilisation, bringing the population around them into submission
by their persuasive preaching, like the priests of Buddha
in India and Java, adopting the language of their disciples,
and building marvellous temples in honour of the gods they
preached. The bas-reliefs at Palenque, Lorillard, and Tikal
tell this story very plainly.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Toltecs in the south of Yucatan is thus
placed beyond a doubt; but the explanation given of the
abandonment of Chichen by its inhabitants is highly unsatisfactory.
That exodus, produced by secondary causes, was determined
by the still living tradition that establishments had been
formed by their ancestors in the south of the peninsula, and
that Tikal, which at that time was perhaps still standing, formed
the chief centre. It is more than probable that the caciques
of Chichen had kept up some intercourse with one of the
cradles of their family, and when they set their face in that
direction, it was but an instinctive yearning to return to Peten.
To the same Toltec branch is clue also the colonisation and
civilisation of the north of Guatemala, Tikal being the central
point, whence some directed their march north, whilst others
went south.</p>

<p>If we are to believe the priest of Quiché, “he saw at Coban
a great city which filled him with astonishment.” We have
heard nothing of such a place, nor has any other traveller;
but if we follow the affiliation, it is highly probable that Coban
was a station of the Tikal-Toltec branch, which from this point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">Pg 474</a></span>
went east, where they founded Copan and Quirigua in the
province of Chiquimula. Copan was standing at the Conquest,
as well as Utatlan, Atitlan, Xelahu, Patinamit, and several
other Guatemalec cities, which were destroyed by Alvarado.
Copan was forced to yield after a desperate struggle to Hernandez
de Chaves, one of his lieutenants (1530), and Juarros tells
us that Fuentes visited it in 1700, when “the Great Circus
still remained entire.”</p>

<p>We follow Stephens<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> in the description and illustration of
these monuments, and find that the most remarkable are monolith
idols, which are only the development of the stelæ and monoliths
at Tikal, and that the inscriptions, bas-reliefs, and idols are
like those of the places we have already described, except that
they seem to us to belong to a later period, contrary to Stephens,
who assigned an original civilisation to them. But Stephens
began at the wrong end when he made Copan the first scene
of his investigations, and that accounts for his want of insight
in not having perceived that these monuments were the outcome
of an old civilisation. Later, his better informed judgment
enabled him to grapple with the difficulties, and arrive at the
truth. We claim but to be his disciple.</p>

<p>The first drawing is a finely sculptured head, which he calls
a king; but this bearded man, whose head is locked in a
huge serpent’s jaw, whose head-dress consists of wreathed
serpents, or a Guatemalec turban, is a personification of Quetzalcoatl,
and though the type is somewhat changed the attributes
are unmistakable.</p>

<p>We have no reliable description of the monuments at Copan;
but from what Stephens says of them, they seem to differ from
those we have explored. Juarros’ description of Santa Cruz
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">Pg 475</a></span>del Quiché, Utatlan, and other Guatemalto-Toltec centres,
recalls Mexican cities, which may well be, since they were
situated also on plateaux, and must necessarily have had a
different appearance from those of the warm regions.</p>

<p>The Toltec branch of the Pacific, although influenced by their
surroundings, had preserved the traditions of Anahuac, and
reproduced the buildings and the same mode of living suggested
by the resemblance of their present to that of their former homes.
But these two branches met for the first time at Copan, shown
in the mixture of the two different styles, where the palaces and
temples seem to us Guatemalto-Toltec, whilst the idols are
Tzendal-Toltec, and the stone bas-reliefs of our temples are
replaced here and at Quirigua by enormous monoliths of 12 to
20 feet high by 4 wide and 3 feet thick.</p>

<p>At Kabah, which we think coeval with Copan, we noticed the
exaggerated ornamentation which marks two different epochs; the
same thing happened here, and is a new instance of a general
tendency, which may almost be called a law; nor is it necessary
to be an archæologist to affirm of these monuments, that they are
not the beginning but the end of an art, for here we see monoliths
loaded with all the ornaments and architectural designs which
at an earlier epoch had spread over idols, bas-reliefs, and palaces.</p>

<p>The inscriptions not only retain the ancient characters, in
which faces and human figures were intermingled, but they
sometimes entirely consist of human figures grouped in the most
violent postures. This is not all: the same idol personifies several
deities, shown in the first we reproduce, where the great central
figure, having a woman’s head, emerges from a dragon’s jaw,
recalling Quetzalcoatl; whilst the band which surrounds his loins
consists of human figures, ranged over a wreath of maize, showing
the attributes of the Tlaloc at Palenque, and also of Chalchiuhtlicue
and Centeotl, the Mexican Ceres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">Pg 476</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">MONOLITH IDOL OF COPAN (FROM STEPHENS).</p></div>

<p>The decorative designs of these monuments show at a glance
their correlation with the bas-reliefs and monuments introduced
earlier in this work. They generally consist of volutes, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">Pg 477</a></span>
head of a small monster offered by one of the figures to a symbolic
bird, as in the cross at Palenque, and a similar figure in the
Temple of the Sun; some of the details belong to Lorillard,
whilst others are like the wood bas-reliefs at Tikal.</p>

<p class="caption">OTHER SIDE OF SAME ALTAR.</p></div>

<p>But we will yet take another idol, the better to show these
analogies. The figure stands square instead of being carved in
profile; the forehead, like that in the Temple of the Sun at Tikal,
is less retreating, whilst the head-dress recalls both Tikal, Yucatan,
and Lorillard. The ornaments are of the usual type, and the
petticoat of the goddess has the diamond design which we saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">Pg 478</a></span>
at Palenque and in the Uplands. The sides of the idol are
covered with a series of characters like those on the bas-reliefs
at Lorillard, Tikal, and Palenque; the affiliation cannot be
controverted.</p>

<p>Again, let us take Stephens’ interesting altar, 6 feet long by
4 feet high. The top is divided into thirty-six tablets of hieroglyphics;
whilst the sides are sculptured with human figures in
profile, seated cross-legged on a kind of cushion, having a
turban or Guatemalec head-dress, with the cranial deformation
much diminished, as in the idols. These new types, mixed
with others familiar to us, are due to the immigrant Toltec
tribes who met after two centuries of wandering, so that this
monument shows both: the figures being Quiché-Toltec or
Guatemalto-Toltec, whilst the symbolical characters are pure
Toltec; the latter, be they near the figure, on his dress, or
his seat, give the names and titles of the beings they serve to
decorate.</p>

<p>Palacio recognised the Toltec civilisation at Copan, since in
a letter to Philip II. (1576), “he found these monuments in ruins,
but superior to any edifice of the same nature built by the inhabitants
of these regions.” Their traditions make them attribute
these edifices to <i>emigrants from Yucatan</i>, which he thinks
probable, “because of the resemblance between these monuments
and those he met in Yucatan and Tabasco.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> Consequently we
see at Copan the end of an old art mixed with another equally
old, the combination of which produces a new manifestation in
the American civilisation. It is idle to speculate how it would
have developed had it not been stopped in its inspiration and
destroyed by the arrival of the Spaniards.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">Pg 479</a></span></p>
<p>We follow Veytia in tracing the migratory movements of
the Toltecs from the north-west as far as Tula: but from this
point we mark their march towards the south after the breaking
up of their empire. Torquemada mentions a sub-division, which
fell back on Huaxteca, whilst the main body coasted the seaboard
of the Mexican Gulf, building Blasillo, where palaces and temples
are still standing, and Comalcalco (Centla). Here they divided;
some following the Carmen lagoon entered Yucatan by Patonchan,
of which the chief or reigning family were the Cocomes; Aké,
Izamal, Mayapan, etc., were built by this branch.</p>

<p class="caption">INSCRIPTION OF LORILLARD CITY.</p></div>

<p>The others directed their march towards the south and
founded Palenque and Ocosingo, then falling back on the
Usumacinta, settled at Lorillard and the more distant Tikal.
Here took place the branching off which we mentioned above;
one division, from which the Tutulxius were descended, going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">Pg 480</a></span>
north, founded Nohbeccan, Iturbide, Labna, Kabah, Uxmal,
and Chichen; whilst the other built Coban, Copan, and Quirigua,
where they met and amalgamated with the branch which had
followed the Pacific coast. The latter, after they had traversed
the region inhabited by the Zapotecs (Oaxaca), tarried at Tehuantepec,
then resumed their march towards Guatemala, where they
laid the foundations of Utatlan, Xelahu, Atitlan, Patinamit, etc.,
and joined the northern branch at Copan.</p>

<p class="caption">STELA OF TIKAL (FROM A. MAUDSLAY).</p></div>

<p>As will be seen, this is but a broad outline which leaves out
a number of localities we could name, and many others which
we do not know, but which we hope will be discovered some day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">Pg 481</a></span>
We have also traced in our map the return march of the Iztas
(or Iztaes) from Chichen to Tayasal.</p>

<p class="small">The line in our Map which to the north goes into Huaxteca, shows the course
pursued by the Toltec branch mentioned by Ixtlilxochitl and Torquemada; and
the monuments in that region, which all bear a resemblance with those of Tabasco
and Yucatan, are the works of the Toltecs just as much as those of the above-mentioned
states. We wish also to point out that the towns in this region, as
yet unexplored, were inhabited and the monuments standing at the time of the
Conquest, and that a few years sufficed to dilapidate and deface them.</p>

<p class="small">Nicholas de Witt, who visited Huaxteca in 1543, in a letter (1554) published
by Ternaux Campan, says that the region contained great cities and was more
thickly populated than any other, but that when he visited it, <i>twenty years</i> after the
Conquest, it was deserted and covered with ruins; because some years before, the
Spaniards had basely massacred the inhabitants. They had invited all the chiefs
to a conference in a large wooden house, and burnt them alive. After this cruel
act, the <i>Huaxtecs abandoned their town and retired in the woods</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is positively nothing new to say about the long, wearisome
journey from Copan to Tenosiqué; it is the usual road through
forest, with no incidents to mark it from former journeys, which
besides we performed in Stephens’ and Maudslay’s company
from whom we borrow both descriptions and monuments. We
will therefore start from Tenosiqué, where our personal explorations
begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">Pg 483</a></span></p>

<p>In order to avoid going by Frontera, which I had visited
several times, I returned to Palenque, crossed the Sierra of
Chiapas, that I might see S. Cristobal, Tehuantepec, and the
various Indian villages which are found along that road new
to us.</p>

<p>As it was a long distance, offering many difficulties over almost
impassable mountain paths, which at times are almost perpendicular,
I dismissed my men and sent Lucian and one of my two
servants to wait for us at Mexico, whilst Julian and I, with our
arms and photograph apparatus, set out for S. Domingo del
Palenque, where I engaged six men to convey our baggage over
the Sierra to S. Cristobal.</p>

<p>I had been duly instructed upon the route I was to follow
by the alcalde, so that leaving our men to come after us, which
we were assured would be done immediately, Julian and I
mounted our horses, and we were soon galloping in the direction
of the rancho, which we reached towards ten o’clock; here our
guide wished to return to Palenque, but I required him to await
the arrival of the tamenes, who were not yet in sight, and with
whom I could not communicate without his help. But the whole
day passed in fruitless expectations, all the more disagreeable that
they had all the supplies, and we were reduced to a large ball of
<i>posole</i>,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> not much for empty stomachs, so towards evening the
guide went along the river’s banks in search of snails, and we
had to content ourselves with them for our supper.</p>

<p>The following day I sauntered in the wood to do something,
and found a tortoise of 8 or 10 inches long, having its lower shell
furnished at both ends with two appendices, which enabled the
fellow to shut himself up and defy all enemies, a true snuff-box
tortoise. I thought at first of keeping it; but, alas for human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">Pg 484</a></span>resolve! by noon it was in the pot fast turning into delicious
soup.</p>

<p>Two men who were returning from Palenque, brought us
news at last of our porters; they had got drunk on the money
which, according to custom, they had received in advance from
us, an affray had followed, they had been handed over to the
police and shut up in jail; they were, however, to be released
on that very day, and a few hours would bring them to us.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">SNUFF-BOX TORTOISE (<i>Cinostemon Leucostomum</i>)</p></div>

<p>The guide, who was anxious to go home, exchanged a few
words with the men which I could not understand, then informed
me that they were willing to carry my luggage to S. Pedro, where
we should find ample accommodation, plenty of supplies, and that
it would be a better place to wait for our tamenes. I agreed, and
we were soon winding up the sierra, which, at first gradual, soon
became precipitous, obliging us to throw off our clothes and to retain
only our nether garments, and even these we cut above the knee
to facilitate our movements. The men carried everything, but far
from feeling the weight put upon them, they seemed to have wings
to their feet, and left us far behind to toil up as best we might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">Pg 485</a></span></p>

<p>At last we halted by the side of a stream, where our much
reduced <i>posole</i> was entirely consumed amongst us all. Somewhat
refreshed with the rest and food, we resumed our ascent, but
towards evening the cravings of the stomach were again felt, and
our sluggish legs refused to carry us much further. The porters
had indeed drawn our attention to some <i>hoccos</i> hovering among
the branches, but I had missed one at a few yards’ distance, and
the scarcity of ammunition, the bulk of which was with the missing
tamenes, made me unwilling to venture on another shot unless
I was sure of it.</p>

<p>Poor Julian was fast losing heart; fortunately just then we
heard cries of monkeys quite near, and deviating to one side we
came upon a whole tribe of them perched in the queerest attitudes,
which our approach did not seem to scare in the least, giving me
ample time to take aim at a fine powerful fellow some fifty or
sixty feet overhead, which I brought down with one single shot.</p>

<p>We had now reached a broad expanse of several thousand
feet above the level of the ocean, and were only a few yards from
the rancho Nopa, built for the use of travellers; the night was
drawing near, and we were glad to get some kind of shelter.
Meanwhile the female monkey had followed us with her two
young ones, uttering the most lamentable cries; they had perched
on a tree quite close, and the mother was now watching with
mournful eyes her late lord being cut up.</p>

<p>But, alas for human sympathy! far from being touched at
this mark of conjugal devotion, I only thought of the substantial
meal we should make after our long fast, and that the animal
was large enough to last over the next day for our breakfast,
when with renewed strength we set out again, and after hours
of wearisome toiling, we came upon a large river not marked on
the map, which we crossed in a pirogue, and two hours more
brought us in view of S. Pedro, an Indian village consisting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">Pg 486</a></span>
about a hundred huts, scattered over some of the hillocks with
which the plain is dotted. No admixture of white blood is seen
here, and nothing but Indian is spoken.</p>

<p>I directed my steps towards the centre of the village, hoping
to find a hut in which to rest our weary limbs; but the first
I ventured into was occupied by women, who shrieked with
terror on perceiving me and rushed out, whether at the arms
I carried, or because I was white, must remain a mystery to
the end of time. Their cries brought the whole female population
into the street (the men were at the milpa), glaring at me and
scampering away the moment I tried to get near.</p>

<p>My repeated inquiries for “el Gobernador” (the alcalde is
so styled here), at last induced the boldest in the crowd to
point to a large building to our right; I went in and found
some young girls, clad from the waist in a cotton garment,
engaged in breaking Indian corn on <i>mectates</i>, whilst an elderly
woman similarly attired was stirring a kind of Scotch broth, boiling
on the hearth, the smell of which was so appetising that I immediately
pantomimed to the old dame to give me some, showing at
the same time a shining real in my open palm to help my eloquence.
But the virago, brandishing her spoon in my direction, advanced
to prevent my further ingress, pouring out a volley of questions
and vituperations the while, which, of course, I could not
understand, but which plainly meant that she was not to be
persuaded by such means, and that the sooner I vacated the
place the better for me.</p>

<p>I hesitated what I should do; but, reflecting that I was in
the stronghold, with no better chance of a welcome anywhere,
I determined to stand my ground, and going into the yard
I seized the first fowl within my reach, wrung its neck, and
holding it up to the woman, signed to her to cook it, presenting
her with three reals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">Pg 487</a></span></p>

<p>The fowl had been eaten, and I was fast asleep under the
verandah, when I was aroused out of my slumbers by the owners
of the hut, who had just returned from the fields, and were now
standing before me with hatred in their looks and demeanour.
They were soon joined by others, and all signed to me to leave
the place immediately; I thought it no disgrace to yield before
such numbers and to go to the <i>cabildo</i>, “common room,” filled
already with natives from various parts of the sierra on their
way to or from “las playas.” Here fortunately I found a meztizo
who spoke Spanish and was civil enough to arrange with an old
couple to provide me with some food twice a day, and who promised
besides to hurry on my tamenes as soon as he met them.</p>

<p>Shall I ever forget the first night I spent in this horrible
cabildo, where all the abominations which are inseparable from
barbarians seemed to have concentrated in it: the atmosphere
was such as could be expected in a room overflowing with unwashed,
unkempt, uncared-for humanity, alive with dirt! Sleep
was of course out of the question; whilst a tropical rain precluded
our sleeping in the open air.</p>

<p>We had three days of this nameless, indescribable horror; on
the fourth the tamenes arrived looking rather foolish, displaying
their bruises to account in some way for their delay. I was too
thankful to have some clean clothes and a hammock in which
to sleep, away from the filth of the last days, to think of reprimanding
them, and I was so worn-out with the unrest of the
preceding nights, that I slept on until broad daylight.</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes, I saw indeed my packages arranged
as they were the evening before, but no tamene was standing
by them. A horrible suspicion crossed my mind. I rushed out
followed by Julian to look for them, but ere long I had to convince
myself that they had made off in the night to save
themselves another toilsome journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">Pg 488</a></span></p>

<p>Armed with gun and revolver, I went round the village to
find other porters, but my offers were met everywhere with jeers
and defiant looks, until at last, disheartened and hardly knowing
what to do, I bethought me of the old Indian couple that had
cooked my dinner and had betrayed some signs of sympathy at
our mishaps, and begged them to take care of my luggage until
I should send for it from S. Cristobal. Then provided with only
what I thought strictly necessary for three days’ march (rugs, waterproofs,
shot, a <i>posole</i> cake, and some ham), which I made into two
bundles, one for Julian and the other for myself, we took the road
to Tumbala, fervently hoping never to set foot in S. Pedro again.</p>

<p>I cannot say much for our first attempts at turning tamenes:
the straps supporting our burdens cut into our flesh, we advanced
slowly and with great difficulty, and although it was comparatively
cool in the forest, I felt hot to suffocation; we stopped
every five minutes to take breath and ease ourselves of our
burdens, but after a while we got used to our new mode of life,
which was not so bad after all, for we found plenty of water on
the road, and towards noon we sat down by the side of a running
stream to eat our ham and <i>posole</i>, when Julian felt so exhilarated
by his present comfort, as to indulge in small jokes about our
late sad experiences.</p>

<p>Still holding our course up the sierra, at night we encamped
at a considerable height, not far from a spring, round which
we cleared a kind of green tent, lighted a good fire, which we
took in turns to keep alive, as a protection against moisture
and wild beasts. As day broke I heard a cock crow, showing
that we were close to some habitation, but according to my
calculations we should reach Tumbala in a few hours, and having
enough for our immediate wants, we only thought of pressing
on to the end of our journey, where I knew we were expected,
when everything would be made right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">Pg 489</a></span></p>

<p>And now the forest was truly grand, glowing in all the
splendour of a tropical vegetation; some of the arborescent ferns
rising to a height of 40 feet, with far-spreading leaves, whilst
the branches of the stately trees were gaily festooned with the
entire family of orchids and other flowering parasites of the most
brilliant hues. Long processions of <i>arrieras</i> (ants), laden with
bits of foliage which they tilted up like a sail, gave them the
appearance of a green moving belt.</p>

<p>Towards evening we met an Indian on his way home from “las
playas,” of whom we bought some maize-bread, and at night we
encamped like the evening before in the forest. But a heavy
storm arose; the driving rain and hail penetrated our waterproofs,
drenched our garments, and threatened to put out the fire as well;
the trees were cracking and falling about us like hail. By-and-by
the rain ceased, and we could hear the hard breathing of a jaguar
quite close to us; but the wood, thoroughly saturated with the
rain, smouldered on without burning up; so that, in darkness
which could be felt, I discharged at random the contents of
my revolver, but the brute kept his ground until the first
morning light, thus preventing our having any rest.</p>

<p>We rose with the lark, and, resuming our march, came in
sight of Tumbala towards ten o’clock, having employed three
days over forty-two miles! The cura was out, and our clothes
soiled with mud, rain, and adhering brambles, gave us such
a sorry appearance, that the housekeeper at first refused us
admittance. After a while the cura returned; he was a man of
about thirty years of age, with a benevolent countenance, full
of kindness and sympathy over our hardships.</p>

<p>“Leave the tamenes to me to be dealt with as they deserve
for their breach of contract; although the rogues are likely
to keep away until they know you are out of the district.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dinner, to my deep satisfaction, was placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">Pg 490</a></span>
on the table; I did ample justice to the viands, which were
well cooked and neatly served, the wine generous and the
Comitan brandy excellent, but my late harassing life had so
weakened me that when I tried to get up I could not steady
myself, so I went to lie down, and slept on until noon of the
following day, when I felt completely restored and myself again.
The priest lent me some clothes till mine came, which, by his
care, had been sent for; and thus accoutred, I went about
with him fully enjoying my return to civilised life.</p>

<p>Tumbala has nothing to distinguish it from other Indian
towns; it stands on one of the highest levels of the <i>Sierra Madre</i>,
girt with a dark belt of pines and long lines of shadowy hills,
stretching away in the far distance. The population numbers
about 12,000 inhabitants, who live in the forest rather than in
their mud cabins, so that the pastor is sometimes three months
without seeing the male portion of his congregation.</p>

<p>A taxation of six shillings per head a year is the only act of submission
to the State exacted from this semi-barbarous but almost
independent people. The Governor, generally a native, collects
the taxes, but in all other matters he is the humble servant of
the padre, in whom are vested all powers both civil and spiritual;
on the whole he makes very good use of his immense influence,
in curbing and directing these childish, untutored, ignorant
people.</p>

<p>Crimes are punished by jail or the <i>bastinado</i>; if the treatment
is primitive, it suffices in all cases, which may well be, for the
number of strokes varies from twelve to one hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>Whilst I was here, I witnessed a curious incident: one day
a woman came to the cura demanding justice against her son,
who had been wanting in respect to her. The son, a big, tall
fellow of five-and-twenty, was with her; both were the worse for
drink. The priest remonstrated with the mother, but she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">Pg 491</a></span>
obdurate; the law allowed her twelve strokes, and twelve strokes
she would have. “Never mind, Señor Padre, I know I don’t
deserve them, but she is my mother, and since it pleases her, I
may well consent to it.” He got his twelve strokes “<i>pro formâ</i>,”
after which they fell into each other’s arms perfectly happy. On
another occasion two brothers preferred receiving twelve strokes
rather than make friends.</p>

<p>They own no money except what they earn as tamenes for
the whites of the districts round about S. Cristobal. They still
retain the character of the old tamenes, who followed armies and
merchants in their distant expeditions; they begin their apprenticeship
at eight years of age, when they accompany their elders,
carrying, like Æsop, the supplies of the company; their load is
increased from year to year until it sometimes reaches two hundred
pounds. Their avocation is so ingrained in their habits, that
they fancy they cannot walk unless they carry some weight, so
that on their return journey they generally have a few stones at
their back.</p>

<p>But the larger proportion of their earnings finds its way to
the padre; for marriages, christenings, confessions, burials, masses,
etc., have all to be paid for, so that the priest of Tumbala is not
badly off, but he shares with his bishop, who must have a well-feathered
nest. Besides this, the simple natives give in kind
of all they have; they are proud when they are required to
repair their pastor’s house, to run his errands, or carry him over
the sierra when he travels; they consult him in all things, fully
believing that the cura is able to help and see them out of all
their troubles.</p>

<p>My luggage arrived at last, and as there was nothing to keep
me any longer at Tumbala, I took leave of the hospitable priest,
amply provided with food and letters of introduction to all the
curas along the road, and set out for Jajalun, only a few hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">Pg 492</a></span>
distant, on foot, for the simple reason that no horses or mules
could be obtained.</p>

<p>Jajalun stands on the declivities of the Cordillera, sloping
down towards the Pacific; the hills are clad with dark forests of
pines, whilst fields show signs of careful cultivation, where black
beans intervene with golden harvests of maize. The population
has a good sprinkling of half-castes or meztizos, who speak Spanish
and live like the ancient aborigines, in houses built with mud
coated over with plaster; their manners are those of the villages
of the Mexican plateaux, rather than of the settlements we have
just visited. <i>Anteburros</i>, “tapirs,” people the forests and the
streams.</p>

<p>We were received in the same kind manner by the cura as
we had been at Tumbala, and having thoroughly rested mind and
body, we did not much mind having again to perform our next
journey on foot. The road was good, and lay across level ground,
we were well provided with all the necessaries of life, so that there
was little to complain of; indeed, Julian was so set up with the
good cheer and the kind attentions of the women during the
last few weeks that, in his desire to entertain me, he sang
nearly all the way what was meant to be a comic song.</p>

<p>At Chilon we found horses which carried us comfortably
to Citala, where a Dominican friar, for the time being cura of
the place, received us in his house and entertained us most
hospitably. I found him a remarkably agreeable, well-bred man,
of far greater culture than is generally the case with his brethren.
Some years before he had published his views upon religious
reform, and this had brought him in bad odour with his superiors.
He was by nature of a sensitive, proud disposition, and he felt
keenly the slur cast upon him by his banishment in which the
best years of his life were frittered away, and his health undermined
by the unhealthy climate and the absence of all social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">Pg 493</a></span>
intercourse. The days I spent in the society of this genial,
superior man, seemed to flit by unheeded; whilst I was given
opportunities of noting down new <i>traits</i> in the character of the
natives.</p>

<p>One day I happened to be in the church, whilst the friar
was in his confessional, and, to my surprise, I saw him confess
two persons at the same time, each speaking loud
enough to be heard at some distance. Naturally enough I
expressed my surprise to the padre. “Oh! it is the custom
here; they do not think anything of it, and it not unfrequently
happens that I confess husband and wife at the same time.
You are aware that the seventh commandment is utterly disregarded
by these people; so that when they happen to confess
together, they of course hear of each other’s delinquencies, and
the two culprits look daggers at each other across the grating.
They are imposed a penance, which is always observed, are both
absolved on their promise to go and sin no more, and the couple
return peacefully to their home. It was a confession made in
the presence of God, who has forgiven, therefore the husband
has nothing to complain of; but if he found out the backslidings
of his wife through any other means, it would go hard with her.
Do not hurry away,” said the padre, “to-morrow I join twenty
couples in holy matrimony; it is a saving of time and drunkenness,
for one entertainment will do for all.”</p>

<p>I was much interested in a pretty patriarchal custom here,
which consists in the female population coming up every evening
to kiss their pastor’s hand and ask for his blessing. I came in
for my share, and had then the opportunity to notice that they
are not remarkable for good looks; and, as the priest said, there
is small merit in resisting the devil.</p>

<p>We wished the friar farewell, and continued our course to
Cankuk; where the kindly “padre” procured some men to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">Pg 494</a></span>
us some twenty-seven miles of such bad road, that even the
Indians do not trust their animals on it. It is the usual mode of
travelling in this part of the sierra, but an uncomfortable feeling
of the unfitness of things is experienced, in subjecting a fellow
creature to become a beast of burden on your account. However,
the feeling soon wears off, for they do not seem to mind it themselves,
and they handle you about as they would a bale of cotton,
and have a disagreeable way of flourishing you over fathomless
abysses, which I found so trying that I deemed it prudent to
perform the precipitous descent on foot.</p>

<p>This gave me the opportunity of stopping at my leisure to
admire the grand prospect which from time to time opened out
before us; the valley with its gay confusion of cultivated fields,
and the houses of S. Cristobal shining in the sun. The ancient
capital of Chiapas rises on a narrow plateau more than 7,000 feet
above the level of the ocean, with a population of some 12,000
inhabitants; its climate is colder and damper than that of Mexico,
and if we except the church of S. Domingo, possesses no edifice
of interest. The houses are all built on the same pattern, and
few are more than one story high, with no outer ornamentation
of any kind. It looks what it really is, a poor, miserable place.</p>

<p>The market of S. Cristobal is the only one in Mexico where
bags of cocoa are still used as currency, as in the time of
Montezuma. The clergy of Chiapas, formerly so wealthy, has
been deprived, like that of Mexico, of its emoluments and glebe
lands, and the religious orders have also been suppressed.</p>

<p>We next follow the circuitous road to Chiapas, through a
wild and dreary country, intersected by torrents, barrancas, and
precipices of two or three thousand feet. We passed Ystapa,
where the priest wished to know if France was a sea-port like
Vera Cruz; and pressing on we reached the broad level of
Chiapas, covered with sombre forests, bounded to the rear by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">Pg 495</a></span>
hills of Tuxtla, whilst to the right and left the eye travels over
a boundless distance. Along the river which traverses the plain,
specks of white show where the town lies.</p>

<p>We only stopped at Chiapas the time necessary to change
horses, and pushed on to Tuxtla, twenty miles beyond, now the
capital of the province, where no mules could be hired, and we
were obliged to buy horses to take us on to Oaxaca. No danger
was to be apprehended, for the country was quiet; we were,
moreover, fully armed and provided with a good map.</p>

<p>Osocantla, our first stage, exhibits abundant traces of volcanic
action. We hold our course across great rolling plains, dotted with
forests and patches of cultivation, intersected by broad rivers, and
pass Santa Lucia, the finest hacienda in these parts, surrounded
by huts occupied by the labourers employed on the property; it
possesses a sugar-mill, and a granary for corn and maize, whilst
the woods are peopled with wild turkeys, pheasants, numerous red
aras, green parrots, and clouds of gaudy butterflies, rivalling the
beauty of the vegetable creation nowhere so brilliant as here,
where the river, with its interminable windings, casts across this
privileged land a perpetual green and variegated mantle.</p>

<p>Life here is primitive and patriarchal: In the evening after
prayers, the servants come round to take their orders for the
next day, kiss the master’s hand and wish him good night; then
they all collect in the yard to enjoy, what they are pleased to call,
an hour’s rest, which consists in games, singing and dancing, some
accompanying the singers on the <i>marimba</i>, a kind of piano which
is played with small sticks topped by india-rubber paddings, an
instrument found also in South Africa, where it bears the same
name, whence in all probability it was imported to America by
negroes at the time of the Conquest.</p>

<p>We resume our march, and pass successively Llano Grande,
Casa Blanca, S. Pedro, and La Gineta; the latter is one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">Pg 496</a></span>
highest peaks of the sierra, clad with forests on the eastern side,
but is only carpeted with grass towards the Pacific. We toil up
its long winding ascent, but when we reach its summit, one of the
grandest panoramas unfolds before our enraptured gaze. Looking
back to the north, which we have just left, is the Cordillera,
gradually sloping down from the high plateaux of Chiapas, to its
deep, sombre valleys; whilst beyond are vast plains, and in the
far distance the glimmering light of the Mexican Gulf; before us,
to the south, is the verdant Gineta; lower down, the rich plain
of Tehuantepec, bound on the horizon by the broad sheet of the
Pacific. The pass of the Gineta is very dangerous in winter,
owing to the violent winds which then prevail, carrying off both
man and beast.</p>

<p>As we advance haciendas disappear, and we find the sides
of the roads dotted with villages as in Mexico. The population
seems indolent and inert, content to pinch or starve rather than
exert themselves beyond what they have been accustomed.
Villages are usually built near running streams, in which women
are seen the whole day bathing; but, unlike Diana, they do not
mind being looked upon, contenting themselves with turning their
backs upon the intruder.</p>

<p>We steered our course safely through Zanatepec, Miltepec,
but at Yaltepec we lost our way, and wandered about some time
in the woods before we could find the main road, approaching
Tehuantepec about nightfall, celebrated for its fair women, the
handsomest in the State. They are cast in noble proportions,
and have a dignified, erect carriage. Their dress consists of a
short petticoat reaching the ankles, a jacket which leaves neck
and arms bare; a <i>uipil</i> embroidered with gold and silver covers
their head, whilst their small feet are incased in dainty little shoes.
Their dresses sometimes cost a hundred pounds, a large sum in
this part of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">Pg 497</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-497.jpg" width="500" height="789" alt="TEHUANTEPEC WOMEN." />
<p class="caption">TEHUANTEPEC WOMEN.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">Pg 498<br />Pg 499</a></span></p>

<p>In Tehuantepec are met the peculiar people known as <i>pintos</i>,
“painted,” no misnomer, for they are covered with sickly white
patches extending sometimes over the whole body. The effect
of these patches over their swarthy skin is most repulsive, and
gives them the ghastly appearance of lepers.</p>

<p>There is little or nothing to be said upon our next journey,
except that after S. Juan we enter once more the region of
cactuses in all their variety, and arrive at Oaxaca dust-travelled
and weary. This region enjoys a delicious climate, whilst its soil
is most productive. Ancient ruins are numerous, but they are
little known and still less studied, owing probably to the fact that
they bear no resemblance to those that are known, and that no
historians have mentioned them. Nevertheless, I should ascribe
a Toltec origin to the very interesting ruins of Monte Alban,
some miles distant from the town of Oaxaca, rising to a height
of 4,930 feet, terminating by a partially artificial plateau, extending
over one half square league, covered with masses of stones and
mortar, forts, esplanades, narrow subterraneous passages, and
immense sculptured blocks. The arches or vaults of these
passages are formed by large inclined blocks of stone overlapping
one another, and sculptured with human faces in profile,
resembling the bas-reliefs and figures lately discovered at Santa
Lucia Cosumaluapa in Guatemala.</p>

<p>The grandest ruins are to the south end of the plateau, consisting
mostly of truncated pyramids about 25 feet high, having
steep sides. Enormous masses of masonry show where palaces
and teocalli once stood. The plateau is covered with fragments
of lime, very fine pottery, on which a brilliant red glazing is
observable. An Italian explorer, some years ago, opened some
of the mounds, and found necklaces of agate, fragments of worked
obsidian, and golden ornaments of fine workmanship.</p>

<p>These monuments are different from other ruins in the valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">Pg 500</a></span>
or at Mitla, both in their architecture and materials, which consist
of stones laid in mortar, whereas at Mitla, clay was used with
large pebbles, faced with irregular stones, varying in size
in different parts of the walls. The walls of the temples were
perpendicular, and the ceilings flat; whilst at Monte Alban, we
have the <i>boveda</i>, or overlapping vault.</p>

<p>Our explorations take us next to Mitla, leaving to our left the
fine cemetery called the <i>Pantheon</i>; we pass Santa Lucia, where
cock-fighting still forms the chief amusement of its inhabitants,
and six miles further we come in sight of the charming settlement
of Santa Maria del Tule, peeping out from among groves of
pomegranate, chermoias, and goyavias.</p>

<p>In the open space fronting the chapel, stands the old tree
called <i>Sabino</i>, an object of great veneration on the part of the
natives, who come from all parts of Central America to see it.
Its greatest girth measures 14 paces or 33 feet, to the height
of 20 feet, where it divides, carrying its vigorous branches 100
feet beyond. Some travellers have supposed that three stems
had united to form its colossal trunk, but I was unable to discover
more than one shoot, and its vigour is such, that several centuries
more may safely be predicted for it.</p>

<p>We resume our march, steering towards the east where the
valley becomes very narrow; we pass Tlacolula, following the
spur of the hills, where open quarries still show half-hewn blocks
left by the ancient builders of Mitla, and bearing to the right
we reach S. Dionysio, the last place in the valley; and now
Tatapala is fast disappearing in our rear, and bending to the left
we approach an almost uncultivated valley with bare hills, where
stand the funereal palaces of Mitla. Its sandy soil supports no
vegetation, save a few pitahayas, yielding a delicious fruit the size
of a swan’s egg, having a strawberry flavour.</p>

<p>The ruins of Mitla, which at the time of the Conquest occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">Pg 501</a></span>
a wide space, are now reduced to six palaces and three ruined
pyramids. In the square of the village stands an oblong edifice,
98 feet long by 13 feet wide, faced with unsculptured blocks of
stone, with only one opening at the side.</p>

<p>The next, in our general view of Mitla, is the first edifice
to the north on the slope of the hill, consisting of a confusion
of courts, buildings, and mosaic work in relief of beautiful and
graceful patterns. Below are found traces of very primitive
paintings, representing rude figures of idols and lines forming
meanders, the meaning of which is unknown. The same rude
paintings are found throughout the palace in sheltered places
which have escaped the ravages of time. That such immature
drawings should be found in palaces of beautiful architecture,
decorated with panels of exquisite mosaic work, are facts which,
at first sight, make it difficult to ascribe them to the same
people.</p>

<p>I have called the first ruin the cura’s house, because the
venerable man, who has occupied it for the last fifty years, used
the walls of the ancient edifice to build himself a spacious and
comfortable house. The church adjoining it is also constructed
with the material taken from the ancient palace.</p>

<p>Below, to the left, is a truncated pyramid, built with adobes,
ascended by a stone staircase, having a Christian chapel on its
summit. The Spaniards cleared it so completely of the ancient
temple that no trace remains. The great palace, the walls of
which are still entire, consists of a vast edifice in the shape of
a Tau; the main façade faces south, and is the best preserved
of all the monuments at Mitla, measuring 130 feet, with an
apartment corresponding to it of the same dimensions, and six
monolith columns which supported the roof now fallen in. Three
large doorways gave access to the apartment, having a pavement
covered with cement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">Pg 502</a></span></p>

<p>Both Torquemada and Clavigero, who wrote of these
monuments from hearsay, erroneously ascribe 30 feet and 80 feet
respectively to these columns.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-502.jpg" width="400" height="493" alt="PLAN OF CHIEF PALACE OF MITLA." />
<p class="caption">PLAN OF CHIEF PALACE OF MITLA.</p></div>

<p>The only entrance to the inner court on the right, which is
also cemented, is through a dark narrow passage, having the
walls and the main façade covered with mosaic work in panels,
framed with stones. The court is square, and opens into four
narrow long apartments covered from top to bottom with mosaic
work in relief, arranged in varied parallel bands, extending to
the roof. The lintels over the doorways were formed of huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">Pg 503</a></span>
blocks of stone from 16 feet to 18 feet. We give a ground plan
of the palace, and a cut of the great hall or apartment, together
with a cut of the same hall restored by Viollet-le-Duc, who says
of this monument:</p>

<p class="caption">GREAT HALL RESTORED (MITLA).</p></div>

<p>“The three doorways, opening into the great apartment with
columns, were partly walled up after the erection of the building,
but are plainly visible. Over the doorways are four round holes,
into which were probably fixed hooks supporting a portière.
The monuments of Greece and Rome, in their best time, can
alone compare with the splendour of this great edifice. The
ornamentation is arranged with perfect symmetry, the joints are
carefully cut, the <i>beds</i> and <i>arris</i> of the cornices faultless, showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">Pg 504</a></span>
that the builders were masters of their art. The lintels in this
monument consist, like those of Greece and Rome, of large
blocks of stone; the ornamentation is a series of varied panels,
set in elegant frames, composed of small stones beautifully cut,
arranged in meanders, trellis-work, and diversified in their combinations.”
The distinguished architect ascribes these monuments,
as also those of Yucatan and lower Mexico, to a branch of the
southern civilisation (Malays), separated from the parent stock,
and crossed many times with whites.</p>

<p>It will be apparent to the reader, that the ruins at Mitla
bear no resemblance with those of Mexico or Yucatan, either
in their ornamentation or mode of building; the interiors have
no longer the overlapping vault, but generally consist of perpendicular
walls, supporting flat ceilings, so that it seems almost
impossible to class these monuments with those of Central
America. Nevertheless, there are details which recall Toltec
influence, as we shall show later.</p>

<p>The second palace is the most dilapidated of those which
are still standing. The door, the sculptured lintel, and two inner
columns, are the only remains which serve to show that the
same arrangement was observed here, as in the great hall already
described. The fourth palace is occupied on its southern façade,
which we reproduce, by much more oblong panels, having three
human figures or caryatides. Four other palaces, to the south,
are almost level with the ground, the walls only rising 3 or 4 feet
above it; but the enormous blocks of stone forming the basement,
give them a massive appearance which is not observable
in the palaces that are still standing.</p>

<p class="caption">GENERAL VIEW OF RUINS OF MITLA.</p></div>

<p>The natives make use of them as dwelling-places. Subterraneous
passages, which were opened some years ago, extend
under these ruins; but the hostile attitude of the Indians caused
them to be closed up again before they could be properly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">Pg 505</a><br /><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">Pg 506</a><br /><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">Pg 507</a></span>explored. The ruins are fast falling into decay, hastened by the
natives who resort hither from all parts, and in their ignorance
take away the small stones forming the mosaic work, with the
idea that they will turn into gold. The local government could
easily stop such Vandalism, but it does not seem to care.</p>

<p>We do not know the precise date of these monuments, except
that they had long been in a state of ruin at the time of the
Conquest, and Orozco y Berra<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> thinks that they were destroyed
some time between 1490-1500, in the fierce contests
between the Zapotecs and the invading Aztecs, a fact which
would make them but little older than those we have described
in the course of this work.</p>

<p>If there seems but little resemblance in the general outline
between these monuments and those of the Toltecs or Mexicans,
it must be evident to any one that some of the details, such as
the masks and the small terra-cotta figures, are exactly like those
at Teotihuacan; whilst the small crosses on the panels of the
great palace, and those on the façade of the fourth, are facsimiles
of those on the priest of Quetzalcoatl at Lorillard—assuredly a
most important analogy.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>Torquemada ascribes a Toltec origin to these monuments, for
he says: “After Quetzalcoatl had established himself at Cholula,
in order to carry on there his work of civilisation, he built the
celebrated palaces of Mitla.”</p>

<p>According to Burgoa,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> Quetzalcoatl was worshipped at
Acihuitla; and in the great sanctuary of that town was an idol
called the “Heart of the people. It consisted of a large
emerald the size of a Chili pepper, surmounted by a sculptured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">Pg 508</a></span>bird of exquisite workmanship, wreathed by a serpent. It was
a gem of great antiquity, and so transparent that it shone like
a flame; but the origin of the <i>cult</i> which surrounded it was
forgotten.” Orozco y Berra thinks that the snake represented
Quetzalcoatl, and was a Toltec reminiscence.</p>

<p>The Zapotecs and Miztecs believed themselves autochthones;
they were ignorant of their origin, and had preserved no record
of the time when they established themselves in the country
of which Teozapotlan was the capital. The original name of
Mitla seems to have been <i>Liobaa</i> or <i>Yobaa</i>, “the place of tombs,”
called by the Aztecs <i>Mictlan</i>, or <i>Mitla</i>, place of sadness, hell,
dwelling of the dead, a holy place devoted to the burial of the
kings of Teozapotlan.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p class="caption">GREAT PALACE OF MITLA-OAXACA.</p></div>

<p>The edifices consisted of four upper apartments finely
sculptured, corresponding to an equal number in the lower or
ground story. The upper story was divided between the high
priest, whose apartment was the best furnished of all, the king,
who retired here on the death of a relation, his retinue, and the
levites. In the lower story, the sanctuary formed the central
apartment, having a large slab which served as an altar, on
which were placed the images of the various deities; the side
apartments were devoted one for the king’s burial, the other
for the priests; the fourth, which is supposed to have been the
largest, extended far out under ground, and was supported by
columns like those of the main upper apartment or hall, having
an entrance which was closed by a large slab. In this vast
enclosure were thrown the bodies of the victims and the military
chiefs who had died in battle. Besides these, there were those
who consecrated themselves to the gods, when they were led
to the mouth of this necropolis by a priest, the slab was raised,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">Pg 509</a><br /><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">Pg 510</a><br /><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">Pg 511</a></span>and the self-devoted victim suffered to pass out in the abode
of the dead.</p>

<img src="images/illus-511.jpg" width="500" height="399" alt="SOUTH SIDE OF FOURTH PALACE OF MITLA." />
<p class="caption">SOUTH SIDE OF FOURTH PALACE OF MITLA.</p></div>

<p>The high priest was called “<i>Huiyatoo</i>,” the great sentinel,
he who sees all; his power, which was absolute, was even greater
than the king’s. No person of low degree could see his face
and live. He was the sole mediator between man and the gods;
from him flowed all good gifts, both temporal and spiritual.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>It is probable that Burgoa never visited Mitla, for he only
mentions one palace, whereas eight were still standing in his
time. It seems strange that the Mexican Government should
not undertake the exploration of these ruins, which, as they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">Pg 512</a></span>the burial place of kings and priests, must contain costly robes,
jewels, arms, etc., perhaps even manuscripts that would be most
valuable for a comparative history of the Zapotecs and Aztecs.
This is all the more to be regretted, that there is a stir in the
learned world respecting American ruins and American antiquities.</p>

<p>“In a word,” says Orozco, “great divergence is found
between the Zapotec and Toltec civilisation; they seem to
spring from a common source, their calendar is the same, and
their writing nearly so; both had made great progress in architecture
and ceramic art. But these differences, seemingly slight,
deepen with a maturer study: although based on the same principles,
Zapotec writing has different characters, and objects assume
other conventional forms; colours are more glaring, and at a
first glance it is impossible to confound a Miztec with a Toltec,
Acolhuan, or Mexican manuscript.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>To conclude, although we have visited the ruins of Mitla
more than once, we have not made so careful a study of them,
as of those in Yucatan and Central America; nevertheless it
has been shown that both Torquemada and Orozco see a Toltec
influence in these monuments.</p>

<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Page 269.</span>—<i>Henequen.</i>—Annual fires are run over the country to clear the
ground for the labourers, who then dig holes in the rocky soil and set out the
henequen plants. When of sufficient size, the leaves are cut and carried to the
“scraping machine,” which consists of a large fly-wheel, with strong, blunt knives
carried around on the rapidly revolving wheel. The leaves are pressed by means
of a curved lever, in such a way that the pulpy portion is scraped off, leaving the
fibre. The men feed the machine with astonishing rapidity, pressing the leaf
between the knives and lever with a motion of the leg.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Page 284.</span>—<i>Indians.</i>—The great uprising of the Indians began in 1821, when
Mexico separated from Spain. The large landed proprietors were everywhere
opposed to separation from the mother country, whilst the bulk of the people, who
owned no property, were in favour of it. Later the country was divided in two
parties, in which one wished for an amalgamation with Mexico, whilst the other
was against it. The aborigines cast in their lot with the latter, receiving arms and
promises of independence. After the struggle was over and the Mexicans expelled,
the Indians were dismissed to their homes, and the promises made to them were
not kept.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">In 1846 the Indians saw their opportunity; they swept the eastern coast with
fire and sword, and ravaged the country throughout. At last Mexico, having concluded
peace with the United States, sent an army, and the rebels were very slowly
driven back. But it was years ere peace was restored, and even now annual risings
take place, whilst thousands of square miles are desolate, and hundreds of towns
lie in ruins.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">By calling in the aid of Mexico, Yucatan lost her autonomy, and became one of
the Confederate States of the Republic.<br /><br /></p>

grandeur, each step 4 feet 5 inches long, and 1 foot 5 inches in height.<br /><br /></p>

a unique specimen of this kind of monument in America. It is 20 feet high

in this monument the corbel vault is more convex, and recalls that of a ruinous

distrusting both his great vassals and their allies, sought the support of foreigners
against them. He entered into negotiations with the Aztec military authorities of
Tabasco and Xicalango” (he probably means Goatzacoalco, for it is certain that the
Aztec dominion did not extend beyond that limit), “and it is said that the Mayapan
ruler promised to quarter the troops they should send to his capital. Cocom’s
proposals were accepted, and a strong Nahua garrison entered the city. The names
of the Mexican leaders given in the Maya MS. are <i>Ahzin-Teyut-Chan Tzumtecum</i>,
<i>Taxcal</i>, <i>Ponte-Mit Itztecnat</i> and <i>Kakaltecat</i>.” All the traditions are agreed on the
arrival of the Mexicans in the peninsula, and the investigations of Don Juan Kanil
show that the witnesses he examined swore that his ancestors had come from
Mexico by order of Montezuma the Elder.—<span class="smcap lowercase">C. E. Ancona</span>, “Hist. de Yucatan,”
